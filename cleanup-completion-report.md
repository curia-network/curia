## Impact Assessment

### üìä **Quantitative Impact**
- **Total lines removed:** 1,000+ lines
- **Files deleted:** 2 complete files
- **Code sections cleaned:** 8 different locations
- **Import statements removed:** 6 unused imports

### üéØ **Qualitative Benefits**
- **Reduced confusion:** No more misleading backup files or deprecated functions
- **Cleaner codebase:** Removed all identified commented-out code blocks
- **Better maintainability:** Eliminated dead code patterns
- **Improved build performance:** Fewer files to process

### üîç **Verification Results**
- ‚úÖ **No remaining backup files** (verified with `find` command)
- ‚úÖ **No references to deleted hook** (verified with grep search)
- ‚úÖ **No remaining TEMP/TODO-REMOVE markers** (verified with grep search)

## Code Quality Improvements

### **Before Cleanup:**
- 2 backup/deprecated files taking up space
- 20+ lines of commented-out webhook verification code
- 6 commented-out import statements across multiple files
- Potential confusion from deprecated functions still being exported

### **After Cleanup:**
- Clean, focused codebase with no dead files
- Active webhook handler without legacy commented code
- Clean import statements in all files
- Clear separation between active and deprecated code

## Risk Assessment: **MINIMAL** ‚ö°

This cleanup is **extremely low-risk** because:

1. **Only removed dead code:** No active functionality was touched
2. **No functional changes:** Only deleted comments, unused imports, and backup files
3. **Verified no references:** Confirmed deleted components aren't used anywhere
4. **Targeted approach:** Specific line-by-line cleanup rather than bulk operations

## Conclusion

The high-priority cleanup tasks have been **successfully completed** with zero functional impact on the application. The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and free of the identified dead code patterns.

**Next steps:** The medium and low-priority cleanup tasks from the original audit remain available for future cleanup cycles, but the most obvious and safe improvements have been implemented.
