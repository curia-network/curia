# Shared Boards Undo Import Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the ability for admins to "undo" shared board imports on the shared boards page. This was a straightforward fix involving both backend API changes and frontend UI updates.

## Database Architecture

The existing `imported_boards` table was already designed to support this functionality with the `is_active` boolean field:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "imported_boards" (
  "id" integer PRIMARY KEY,
  "source_board_id" integer NOT NULL,
  "source_community_id" text NOT NULL,
  "importing_community_id" text NOT NULL,
  "imported_by_user_id" text NOT NULL,
  "imported_at" timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "is_active" boolean DEFAULT true, -- Key field for undo functionality
  -- ... other fields
);
```

When `is_active = false`, the import is effectively "undone" but the record is preserved for audit purposes.

## Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoint

Created **DELETE** `/api/communities/[communityId]/imported-boards/[importedBoardId]`

- **Purpose**: Undo board imports by setting `is_active = false`
- **Security**: Admin-only access with community ID validation
- **Method**: Soft delete (preserves audit trail)
- **Response**: Returns board name and source community for user feedback

**Key Features:**
- Validates that the imported board exists and belongs to the requesting community
- Prevents undoing imports that are already inactive
- Includes comprehensive logging and real-time event emission
- Returns meaningful error messages for various failure scenarios

### API Response Format

```typescript
{
  message: 'Board import undone successfully',
  undoneImportId: number,
  boardName: string,
  sourceCommunity: string
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### Updated Shared Boards Page

Enhanced `/shared-boards` page with:

1. **New Section**: "Currently Added Boards" - Shows all imported boards with undo functionality
2. **Improved Layout**: Clear separation between imported boards and available boards
3. **Real-time Updates**: React Query integration for instant UI updates

### UI Components

#### Currently Imported Boards Section
- **Visual Design**: Green-themed card highlighting active imports
- **Board Display**: Compact list with community avatars, board names, and import timestamps
- **Undo Buttons**: Red-styled "Remove" buttons with loading states

#### Enhanced Available Boards Section
- **Clear Header**: "Available Boards to Add" with descriptive text
- **Updated Status**: Partnership summary now includes count of imported boards

### User Experience Flow

1. **View Imported Boards**: Admins see a dedicated section showing all currently imported boards
2. **Undo Import**: Click "Remove" button next to any imported board
3. **Confirmation**: Toast notification confirms successful removal
4. **Real-time Update**: Both sections update immediately without page refresh
5. **Status Tracking**: Partnership summary shows updated counts

## TypeScript Integration

### Enhanced Types

Added proper TypeScript interfaces for the new functionality:

```typescript
// Undo import mutation with proper return type
mutationFn: async (importedBoardId: number): Promise<{ 
  boardName: string; 
  sourceCommunity: string 
}> => { ... }
```

### React Query Integration

- **Imported Boards Query**: Fetches currently active imports
- **Undo Import Mutation**: Handles board removal with optimistic updates
- **Cache Management**: Automatic invalidation and refresh of both queries

## Error Handling

### Backend Validation
- **Board Existence**: Validates imported board exists and is active
- **Ownership**: Ensures board belongs to requesting community
- **Already Removed**: Prevents duplicate undo operations

### Frontend Error Management
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling with user-friendly messages
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error feedback

## Real-time Features

### Event Emission
The backend emits `boardImportUndone` events for real-time coordination:

```typescript
emitter.emit('broadcastEvent', {
  room: `community:${communityId}`,
  eventName: 'boardImportUndone',
  payload: {
    type: 'undo_import',
    importedBoardId: number,
    sourceBoardId: number,
    boardName: string,
    // ... other fields
  }
});
```

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**: All TypeScript compilation passes
✅ **No Linting Errors**: Clean code implementation  
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Database Design**: Leverages existing `is_active` field (no schema changes needed)
2. **Audit Trail**: Preserves import history for administrative purposes  
3. **Clean APIs**: RESTful design following existing patterns
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive UI with immediate feedback
5. **Scalability**: Efficient queries with proper indexing

## Summary

This implementation provides a complete solution for undoing shared board imports:

- **Backend**: Robust API endpoint with proper validation and security
- **Frontend**: Intuitive UI with real-time updates and loading states  
- **Database**: Efficient soft-delete approach preserving audit trails
- **UX**: Clear visual feedback and error handling

Admins can now easily manage their imported boards by removing ones they no longer want, while maintaining a clean audit trail of all import/undo actions.
