## Current State Analysis

### Existing Gating Systems

**1. Board Role Gating (Visibility Control)**
- **Location**: `boards.settings.permissions.allowedRoles[]`
- **Function**: Controls who can SEE the board
- **Behavior**: Invisible boards don't appear in board lists
- **Implementation**: `canUserAccessBoard()` function
- **Admin Override**: Admins see all boards for management

**2. Post Lock Gating (Write Control)**
- **Location**: `posts.lock_id` â†’ `locks.gating_config`
- **Function**: Controls who can COMMENT on posts
- **Behavior**: Users see post but need verification to comment
- **Duration**: 30-minute verification window
- **Implementation**: Pre-verification system with expiry

**3. Legacy Post Response Gating**
- **Location**: `posts.settings.responsePermissions`
- **Function**: Direct UP gating configuration
- **Status**: Being migrated to lock system

### Gap Analysis

**Missing: Board Write Access Control**
- Users can see boards but cannot control who posts in them
- No blockchain-based verification for board participation
- No persistent verification for board-level activities
- No multi-lock combination capabilities

---

## Core Concepts & Design Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns

**Role Gating = Visibility Control**
- Controls whether user can SEE the board
- Based on Common Ground roles/permissions
- Managed by community administrators
- Binary access (visible/invisible)

**Lock Gating = Write Access Control**
- Controls whether user can POST in the board
- Based on blockchain verification requirements
- Configured by board creators
- Graduated access based on verification completion

### Design Principles

1. **Visibility â‰  Write Access**: Users can see locked boards but need verification to contribute
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show requirements clearly before forcing verification
3. **Persistent Verification**: Board verifications last longer than post verifications
4. **Hierarchical Control**: Board locks set minimum requirements, post locks can add more
5. **Multi-Lock Support**: Boards can require multiple complementary verification types
6. **Graceful Degradation**: System works with or without lock gating

---

## Multi-Lock Architecture

### Schema Design

```typescript
interface BoardSettings {
  permissions?: {
    // Existing role-based visibility control
    allowedRoles?: string[];
    
    // NEW: Multi-lock write access control
    locks?: {
      lockIds: number[];                    // Array of required locks
      fulfillment: 'any' | 'all';         // Require ANY lock OR ALL locks
      verificationDuration?: number;       // Override default duration (hours)
    };
  };
  
  // Future extensibility
  writePermissions?: {
    requireBoardVerification?: boolean;    // Board-level verification required
    inheritPostLocks?: boolean;           // Whether post locks add to board locks
    allowedWriteRoles?: string[];         // Role-based write control (separate from visibility)
  };
}
```

### Example Configurations

**Token Gating Only**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "locks": {
      "lockIds": [123],
      "fulfillment": "any",
      "verificationDuration": 4
    }
  }
}
```

**Multi-Lock Requirement**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedRoles": ["member", "contributor"],
    "locks": {
      "lockIds": [123, 456, 789],
      "fulfillment": "all",
      "verificationDuration": 6
    }
  }
}
```

**Role + Lock Hybrid**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedRoles": ["verified"],
    "locks": {
      "lockIds": [123, 456],
      "fulfillment": "any",
      "verificationDuration": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flows

### Flow 1: Discovering a Locked Board

1. **Board Visibility Check**
   - User role validated against `allowedRoles`
   - If fail â†’ Board not shown in lists
   - If pass â†’ Board shown with lock indicators

2. **Board Access**
   - User clicks on board
   - Board loads showing posts (read access granted)
   - Lock requirements displayed prominently
   - "Verify to Post" button visible

3. **Verification UI**
   - Multi-lock verification panel
   - Shows fulfillment mode ("Complete ANY 1 of 3" vs "Complete ALL 3")
   - Individual lock verification buttons
   - Progress tracking for multi-lock scenarios

### Flow 2: Posting in a Locked Board

1. **Write Action Trigger**
   - User clicks "New Post" in locked board
   - System checks board verification status
   - If unverified â†’ Show verification requirements
   - If verified â†’ Allow post creation

2. **Verification Process**
   - Multi-lock verification similar to post gating
   - Longer duration (default 4 hours vs 30 minutes)
   - Persistent across board sessions

3. **Post Creation**
   - Standard post creation flow
   - Board lock verification carries forward
   - Post-specific locks (if any) add additional requirements

### Flow 3: Commenting in a Locked Board

1. **Comment Trigger**
   - User attempts to comment on post in locked board
   - System checks both board AND post verification
   - Hierarchical requirement validation

2. **Verification Logic**
   - Board locks are MINIMUM requirement
   - Post locks are ADDITIONAL requirements
   - User must satisfy both to comment

---

## Verification Duration Strategy

### Current System Limitations

**Post Verifications (30 minutes)**
- Designed for one-off comment interactions
- Short duration prevents abuse
- Forces re-verification for extended sessions

**Board Verification Requirements**
- Users participate in boards over longer sessions
- Multiple posts/comments in single session
- Need balance between security and UX

### Proposed Duration Schema

```typescript
interface VerificationDurations {
  post: number;      // 30 minutes (existing)
  board: number;     // 4 hours (new default)
  custom?: number;   // Board-specific override
}
```

**Duration Tiers**
- **Post-level**: 30 minutes (unchanged)
- **Board-level**: 4 hours (default)
- **Custom**: Board creators can set 1-24 hours
- **Security**: Admin-defined maximums per community

**Implementation Considerations**
- Separate verification tables for different resource types
- Cleanup jobs for expired verifications
- User notification before expiry
- Graceful re-verification flow

---

## Comment Behavior Design

### Hierarchical Verification Model

**Principle**: Board locks establish MINIMUM requirements for any activity in the board

```
Board Lock Requirements (Minimum)
    â†“
Post Lock Requirements (Additional)
    â†“
Final Verification Needed
```

### Verification Logic

```typescript
function getRequiredVerifications(boardId: number, postId?: number) {
  const boardLocks = getBoardLocks(boardId);
  const postLocks = postId ? getPostLocks(postId) : [];
  
  return {
    boardVerifications: boardLocks,
    postVerifications: postLocks,
    totalRequired: [...boardLocks, ...postLocks],
    hierarchical: true
  };
}
```

### Comment Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Board + Post Both Locked**
- User needs board verification (4 hours)
- User needs post verification (30 minutes)  
- Both must be valid to comment

**Scenario 2: Board Locked, Post Unlocked**
- User needs only board verification
- Board verification sufficient for commenting

**Scenario 3: Board Unlocked, Post Locked**
- User needs only post verification
- Standard post gating behavior

**Scenario 4: Both Unlocked**
- No verification required
- Standard commenting flow

### User Experience for Comments

```typescript
interface CommentRequirements {
  canComment: boolean;
  boardVerificationNeeded: boolean;
  postVerificationNeeded: boolean;
  boardVerificationValid: boolean;
  postVerificationValid: boolean;
  requiredActions: string[];
}
```

---

## Edge Cases & Complex Scenarios

### Lock Modification During Active Sessions

**Problem**: User verified for board, then admin modifies board locks

**Solutions**:
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Existing verifications remain valid until expiry
2. **Immediate Invalidation**: Force re-verification for all users
3. **Hybrid**: New locks apply only to new verifications

**Recommendation**: Graceful degradation with notification

### Cross-Board Comment Scenarios

**Problem**: User comments on post that appears in multiple boards

**Current Reality**: Posts belong to single boards, but shareable via links

**Solution**: Verification based on originating board, not viewing context

### Lock Deletion Handling

**Problem**: Board references deleted lock

**Solutions**:
1. **Cascade Delete**: Remove lock reference from board settings
2. **Graceful Fallback**: Ignore missing locks, continue with remaining
3. **Admin Notification**: Alert board admins of missing locks

**Recommendation**: Graceful fallback + admin notification

### Admin Override Behavior

**Levels of Override**:
1. **Community Admin**: Can bypass all gating in their community
2. **Board Moderator**: Can bypass board locks but not role restrictions
3. **Post Author**: Cannot override board locks for their own posts

### Performance Edge Cases

**Large Multi-Lock Boards**
- Boards with 10+ locks require multiple verification checks
- Database query optimization needed
- Caching strategy for frequent access patterns

**High-Traffic Verification**
- Multiple users verifying simultaneously
- Rate limiting on verification endpoints
- Batch verification processing

---

## API Design & Data Flow

### New API Endpoints

```typescript
// Board verification status
GET /api/boards/{boardId}/verification-status
POST /api/boards/{boardId}/verify

// Board lock management
GET /api/boards/{boardId}/locks
PUT /api/boards/{boardId}/locks
POST /api/boards/{boardId}/locks/{lockId}
DELETE /api/boards/{boardId}/locks/{lockId}

// Extended verification endpoints
POST /api/pre-verify/board/{boardId}/{categoryType}
GET /api/verification-status?boardId={boardId}&postId={postId}
```

### Modified API Endpoints

```typescript
// Enhanced board access checking
GET /api/boards -> includes lock verification status
GET /api/posts?boardId={boardId} -> checks board write permissions
POST /api/posts -> validates board lock requirements
POST /api/comments -> validates hierarchical lock requirements
```

### Verification Data Flow

```typescript
interface BoardVerificationRequest {
  boardId: number;
  lockIds: number[];
  fulfillmentMode: 'any' | 'all';
  durationType: 'default' | 'custom';
  customDuration?: number;
}

interface BoardVerificationResponse {
  canWrite: boolean;
  verifications: {
    lockId: number;
    verified: boolean;
    expiresAt: string;
    requiresAction: boolean;
  }[];
  fulfillmentStatus: {
    required: number;
    completed: number;
    sufficient: boolean;
  };
}
```

---

## Database Schema Evolution

### Board Settings Extension

```sql
-- Current boards table already has settings jsonb column
-- New structure:
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedRoles": ["admin", "member"],
    "locks": {
      "lockIds": [123, 456],
      "fulfillment": "any",
      "verificationDuration": 4
    }
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Pre-Verifications Table

```sql
-- Add resource_type to handle both posts and boards
ALTER TABLE pre_verifications 
ADD COLUMN resource_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'post' NOT NULL;

-- Add board_id for board verifications
ALTER TABLE pre_verifications 
ADD COLUMN board_id INTEGER;

-- Update constraints
ALTER TABLE pre_verifications 
ADD CONSTRAINT pre_verifications_board_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (board_id) REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- New unique constraint for board verifications
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pre_verifications_unique_user_board_category 
ON pre_verifications (user_id, board_id, category_type)
WHERE resource_type = 'board';
```

### Lock Usage Tracking

```sql
-- Update lock_stats view to include board usage
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW lock_stats AS 
SELECT l.id,
  l.name,
  l.community_id,
  l.creator_user_id,
  l.is_template,
  l.is_public,
  l.usage_count,
  l.success_rate,
  l.avg_verification_time,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) AS posts_using_lock,
  COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) AS boards_using_lock,
  l.created_at,
  l.updated_at
FROM locks l
LEFT JOIN posts p ON (p.lock_id = l.id)
LEFT JOIN boards b ON (b.settings->'permissions'->'locks'->>'lockIds' @> CAST(l.id AS TEXT))
GROUP BY l.id;
```

## Security & Performance Considerations

### Security Threats

**1. Verification Bypass Attempts**
- Client-side verification manipulation
- Expired verification exploitation
- Cross-board verification reuse

**Mitigations**:
- Server-side verification validation
- Cryptographic challenge signatures
- Resource-specific verification scoping

**2. DoS via Complex Lock Combinations**
- Boards with excessive lock requirements
- Computationally expensive verification chains
- Rapid verification request spamming

**Mitigations**:
- Lock count limits per board
- Rate limiting on verification endpoints
- Async verification processing

### Performance Optimizations

**1. Database Query Patterns**

```sql
-- Efficient board access checking with locks
SELECT b.*, 
  COALESCE(
    JSONB_ARRAY_LENGTH(b.settings->'permissions'->'locks'->'lockIds'), 
    0
  ) as lock_count
FROM boards b 
WHERE b.community_id = $1 
  AND (
    b.settings->'permissions'->>'allowedRoles' IS NULL 
    OR b.settings->'permissions'->'allowedRoles' @> $2::jsonb
  );
```

**2. Caching Strategy**
- Board lock configurations (Redis, 1-hour TTL)
- User verification status (Redis, TTL matches verification expiry)
- Lock metadata (Application cache, invalidate on lock updates)

**3. Batch Operations**
- Bulk verification status checking
- Batch lock requirement fetching
- Parallel verification processing

## Future Extensibility

### Advanced Lock Combinations

**Conditional Logic**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "locks": {
      "requirements": [
        {
          "condition": "OR",
          "locks": [123, 456]  // Token OR Social
        },
        {
          "condition": "AND", 
          "locks": [789]       // AND Identity
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Time-Based Locks**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "locks": {
      "lockIds": [123],
      "schedule": {
        "activeHours": "09:00-17:00",
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "days": ["MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cross-Board Lock Inheritance

**Community Lock Templates**
```json
{
  "communitySettings": {
    "defaultBoardLocks": {
      "lockIds": [100],  // Community membership lock
      "inherited": true,
      "overridable": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Verification Types

**Progressive Verification**
- Initial verification for basic posting
- Enhanced verification for pinning/moderating
- Time-based verification escalation

**Social Reputation Integration**
- Verification based on board participation history
- Community-specific reputation requirements
- Cross-community reputation portability

---

## User Interface Design & Placement Strategy

### UI Placement Analysis

**Option 1: Sidebar Enhancement**
- **Pros**: Persistent visibility, doesn't affect main content layout
- **Cons**: Hidden on mobile by default, limited space for verification details
- **Verdict**: Supplementary indicators only

**Option 2: Mobile Header Integration** 
- **Pros**: Always visible on mobile, space-efficient
- **Cons**: Very limited space, desktop users might miss it
- **Verdict**: Status indicator only, not primary interface

**Option 3: Top of Board Content (Expandable)**
- **Pros**: Highly visible on all devices, progressive disclosure, contextually relevant
- **Cons**: Takes vertical space when expanded
- **Verdict**: **PRIMARY CHOICE** - Best balance of visibility and functionality

### Board Access Status Component

**Component Architecture**
```typescript
interface BoardAccessStatusProps {
  board: ApiBoard;
  userVerificationStatus: BoardVerificationStatus;
  onVerificationStart: () => void;
  onExpand: (expanded: boolean) => void;
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
}

interface BoardVerificationStatus {
  canRead: boolean;
  canWrite: boolean;
  roleAccess: boolean;
  lockAccess: {
    required: boolean;
    verified: boolean;
    partiallyVerified: boolean;
    expired: boolean;
    locks: LockVerificationStatus[];
  };
  hierarchicalRequirements?: {
    boardLocks: Lock[];
    futurePostLocks: boolean;  // Whether posts might have additional locks
  };
}
```

### Visual Design System

**Color Coding Strategy**
```typescript
const ACCESS_STATES = {
  FULL_ACCESS: {
    color: 'emerald',        // Green - can read & write
    bgClass: 'bg-emerald-50 dark:bg-emerald-950',
    borderClass: 'border-emerald-200 dark:border-emerald-800',
    textClass: 'text-emerald-800 dark:text-emerald-200',
    iconColor: 'text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400'
  },
  PARTIAL_ACCESS: {
    color: 'amber',          // Yellow - can read, limited write
    bgClass: 'bg-amber-50 dark:bg-amber-950',
    borderClass: 'border-amber-200 dark:border-amber-800', 
    textClass: 'text-amber-800 dark:text-amber-200',
    iconColor: 'text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400'
  },
  READ_ONLY: {
    color: 'red',            // Red - read only, verification required
    bgClass: 'bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-950',
    borderClass: 'border-red-200 dark:border-red-800',
    textClass: 'text-red-800 dark:text-red-200', 
    iconColor: 'text-red-600 dark:text-red-400'
  },
  NO_ACCESS: {
    color: 'slate',          // Gray - no access (shouldn't normally show)
    bgClass: 'bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-950',
    borderClass: 'border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-800',
    textClass: 'text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-200',
    iconColor: 'text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400'
  }
} as const;
```

### Component States & Responsive Design

**Collapsed State (Default)**
```tsx
<div className={cn(
  "mx-4 md:mx-6 lg:mx-8 mb-6 rounded-xl border transition-all duration-200 hover:shadow-md",
  ACCESS_STATES[accessState].bgClass,

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Full-width component, larger touch targets
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Slight margins, condensed layout
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Full layout with hover effects

**Mobile Optimizations**
```tsx
// Mobile-specific styling
const mobileClasses = {
  container: "mx-3 mb-4 sm:mx-4 sm:mb-6",
  padding: "p-3 sm:p-4", 
  text: "text-sm sm:text-base",
  buttons: "text-sm px-3 py-1.5 sm:px-4 sm:py-2",
  spacing: "space-x-2 sm:space-x-3"
};

// Touch-friendly interaction
const handleTouchInteraction = (e: TouchEvent) => {
  // Prevent double-tap zoom on verification buttons
  e.preventDefault();
  // Handle touch-specific verification flow
};
```

### Integration with Existing Components

**Sidebar Enhancement**
```tsx
// Add lock indicators to board names in sidebar
{board.settings?.permissions?.locks && (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-1 ml-2">
    <Lock className="h-3 w-3 text-amber-500" />
    {isVerifiedForBoard(board.id) ? (
      <CheckCircle className="h-3 w-3 text-emerald-500" />
    ) : (
      <AlertCircle className="h-3 w-3 text-red-500" />
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

**Mobile Header Integration**
```tsx
// Show lock status in mobile header when in locked board
{currentBoard?.settings?.permissions?.locks && (
  <div className="ml-2">
    {isVerifiedForBoard(currentBoard.id) ? (
      <CheckCircle className="h-4 w-4 text-emerald-500" />
    ) : (
      <Lock className="h-4 w-4 text-amber-500" />
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

### Accessibility Considerations

**Screen Reader Support**
```tsx
<div 
  role="region"
  aria-label={`Board access control: ${getAccessTitle(accessState)}`}
  aria-expanded={expanded}
>
  <div 
    role="button"
    tabIndex={0}
    aria-describedby="board-access-description"
    onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
  >
    {/* Status content */}
  </div>
  
  <div id="board-access-description" className="sr-only">
    {getDetailedAccessDescription(accessState)}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Keyboard Navigation**
- Space/Enter: Toggle expanded state
- Tab: Navigate between verification buttons
- Esc: Collapse if expanded

### Animation & Transitions

**Micro-interactions**
```css
.board-access-transition {
  transition: all 0.2s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}

.verification-success {
  animation: pulseGreen 0.6s ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes pulseGreen {
  0%, 100% { background-color: rgb(34 197 94 / 0.1); }
  50% { background-color: rgb(34 197 94 / 0.2); }
}
```

### Component Hierarchy & Data Flow

**Board Page Structure**
```tsx
<BoardPage>
  <BoardAccessStatusComponent />  {/* NEW: Top of content */}
  <BoardHeader />
  <PostsList />
  <CreatePostButton />  {/* Disabled if no write access */}
</BoardPage>
```

**State Management**
```typescript
// Board verification context
const BoardVerificationProvider = ({ children, boardId }: Props) => {
  const [verificationStatus, setVerificationStatus] = useState<BoardVerificationStatus>();
  const [isVerifying, setIsVerifying] = useState(false);
  
  const refreshVerificationStatus = useCallback(() => {
    // Fetch current verification status
  }, [boardId]);
  
  return (
    <BoardVerificationContext.Provider value={{
      verificationStatus,
      isVerifying,
      refreshVerificationStatus,
      startVerification,
      handleVerificationComplete
    }}>
      {children}
    </BoardVerificationContext.Provider>
  );
};
```
