# Emoji Reactions Implementation Research

**Created:** 2025-01-21  
**Status:** Research Phase  
**Priority:** High - Better User Engagement Than Polls  

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation of a **comprehensive emoji reactions system** for Curia2 posts and comments. Unlike the complex poll widget proposal, emoji reactions provide **immediate engagement value** for your community size while being technically straightforward to implement.

## Key Insights from Counter-Analysis

The external AI analysis of the poll widget proposal highlighted that **emoji reactions are the superior engagement feature** for small communities:

- **Immediate value**: Works perfectly for 2-50 users (your scale)
- **Low friction**: One-click engagement vs complex poll creation
- **Universal appeal**: Everyone understands emoji reactions
- **Lightweight**: Simple database design vs complex poll infrastructure

## Research Findings

### **Current Voting System Analysis**

#### **Existing Infrastructure** ‚úÖ
- **`votes` table**: `(user_id, post_id, created_at)` - binary upvoting
- **Board access control**: Already enforced in `/api/posts/[postId]/votes/route.ts`
- **Real-time updates**: Socket.IO integration with `voteUpdate` events
- **Optimistic UI**: `VoteButton.tsx` with proper state management
- **Community scoping**: Votes respect community boundaries

#### **Current Limitations** ‚ùå
- **Binary engagement**: Only upvote/downvote, no nuanced reactions
- **Missing gating enforcement**: Upvotes don't check board write permissions! üö®
- **No comment reactions**: Only posts can be voted on

### **Emoji Reactions Architecture**

#### **Database Design**
```sql
-- New reactions table (replaces binary votes)
CREATE TABLE "public"."reactions" (
    "id" integer DEFAULT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
    "user_id" text NOT NULL,
    "post_id" integer,
    "comment_id" integer,
    "emoji" varchar(10) NOT NULL, -- Unicode emoji (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üòÇ, etc.)
    "created_at" timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    "updated_at" timestamptz DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "reactions_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
    CONSTRAINT "reactions_content_check" CHECK (
        (post_id IS NOT NULL AND comment_id IS NULL) OR 
        (post_id IS NULL AND comment_id IS NOT NULL)
    )
);

-- Composite unique constraint: one instance of each emoji per user per content
-- (Users can give multiple different emojis to same content, but only one üëç per content)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX reactions_user_post_emoji_key 
ON public.reactions (user_id, post_id, emoji) 
WHERE post_id IS NOT NULL;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX reactions_user_comment_emoji_key 
ON public.reactions (user_id, comment_id, emoji) 
WHERE comment_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX reactions_post_id_index ON public.reactions (post_id);
CREATE INDEX reactions_comment_id_index ON public.reactions (comment_id);
CREATE INDEX reactions_emoji_index ON public.reactions (emoji);
CREATE INDEX reactions_created_at_index ON public.reactions (created_at);

-- Foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE reactions ADD CONSTRAINT reactions_user_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE reactions ADD CONSTRAINT reactions_post_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE reactions ADD CONSTRAINT reactions_comment_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (comment_id) REFERENCES comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

#### **Independent Systems Architecture**
The new `reactions` table operates **independently** from the existing `votes` table:

- **Votes**: Binary upvote system (existing functionality preserved)
- **Reactions**: Rich emoji engagement system (new functionality)
- **Both systems**: Operate simultaneously for different engagement types

### **Emoji Set Strategy**

#### **Curated Emoji Set** (Recommended)
```typescript
// Standard reaction emojis (GitHub/Discord/Slack style)
export const REACTION_EMOJIS = [
  { emoji: 'üëç', name: 'thumbs_up', label: 'Like' },
  { emoji: '‚ù§Ô∏è', name: 'heart', label: 'Love' },
  { emoji: 'üòÇ', name: 'laugh', label: 'Funny' },
  { emoji: 'üòÆ', name: 'wow', label: 'Wow' },
  { emoji: 'üò¢', name: 'sad', label: 'Sad' },
  { emoji: 'üò†', name: 'angry', label: 'Angry' },
  { emoji: 'üéâ', name: 'celebrate', label: 'Celebrate' },
  { emoji: 'ü§î', name: 'thinking', label: 'Thinking' }
];
```

**Benefits:**
- **Consistent UX**: Users know what to expect
- **Moderation friendly**: No inappropriate custom emojis
- **Performance**: Limited set means efficient queries
- **Cross-platform**: Standard emojis render everywhere

### **UI/UX Design**

#### **Reaction Bar Component**
```typescript
interface ReactionBarProps {
  postId?: number;
  commentId?: number;
  reactions: ReactionSummary[];
  userReactions: string[]; // Emojis user has reacted with
  onReact: (emoji: string) => void;
  onUnreact: (emoji: string) => void;
  canReact: boolean; // Based on gating permissions
}

interface ReactionSummary {
  emoji: string;
  count: number;
  users: Array<{ userId: string; name: string; avatar?: string }>;
}
```

#### **Visual Design Patterns**
- **Reaction Pills**: `üòÇ 5` with hover showing first 3 user avatars
- **Add Reaction Button**: `üòä+` that opens emoji picker
- **User Indication**: Highlight reactions user has given
- **Hover Tooltips**: "You, Alice, Bob and 2 others reacted with üòÇ"

### **Gating Integration** üö®

#### **Critical Issue: Current Upvotes Don't Check Board Gating**
The existing vote system has a **security gap**:
- Upvotes only check `canUserAccessBoard()` (read permissions)
- **Missing**: Board write permission checks (lock gating)
- **Result**: Users can upvote posts they can't comment on

#### **Proper Gating Implementation**
```typescript
// src/lib/gatingPermissions.ts
export async function canUserReact(
  userId: string,
  postId?: number,
  commentId?: number
): Promise<boolean> {
  // 1. Check board read access (existing)
  const canRead = await canUserAccessBoard(userRoles, boardSettings, isAdmin);
  if (!canRead) return false;
  
  // 2. Check board write access (NEW - lock gating)
  if (boardHasLockGating) {
    const writeAccess = await checkBoardWriteAccess(userId, boardId);
    if (!writeAccess) return false;
  }
  
  // 3. Check post-level gating (existing for comments)
  if (postId && postHasGating) {
    const postAccess = await checkPostGating(userId, postId);
    if (!postAccess) return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### **Deployment Strategy**

#### **Additive Implementation** (Recommended)
- **Phase 1**: Deploy reactions table and API endpoints
- **Phase 2**: Add reaction UI components alongside existing vote buttons  
- **Phase 3**: Both systems operate independently - votes for binary engagement, reactions for rich expression
- **No Migration**: Votes and reactions serve different purposes and both remain

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Core Reactions System** (1-2 weeks)
1. **Database Schema**: Create reactions table with proper indexes
2. **API Endpoints**: 
   - `POST /api/posts/[postId]/reactions` - Add/remove reaction
   - `POST /api/comments/[commentId]/reactions` - Comment reactions
   - `GET /api/posts/[postId]/reactions` - Fetch reaction summaries
3. **Basic UI Components**: `ReactionBar`, `EmojiPicker`, reaction pills
4. **Gating Integration**: Fix current upvote gating + add reaction gating

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features** (1 week)
1. **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO integration for live reaction updates
2. **Reaction Analytics**: Most popular emojis, user reaction patterns
3. **Hover Tooltips**: Show who reacted with each emoji
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press `1-8` to quick-react with common emojis

### **Phase 3: Polish & Optimization** (1 week)
1. **UI Polish**: Animations, better mobile experience, reaction hover effects
2. **Performance Optimization**: Aggregate queries, caching for popular content
3. **Advanced Features**: Reaction analytics, most popular emojis dashboard
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare engagement patterns between votes and reactions

## API Design

### **Reaction Endpoints**

#### **POST /api/posts/[postId]/reactions**
```typescript
interface ReactRequest {
  emoji: string; // 'üëç', '‚ù§Ô∏è', etc.
  action: 'add' | 'remove';
}

interface ReactResponse {
  success: boolean;
  reactions: ReactionSummary[];
  userReactions: string[];
}
```

#### **GET /api/posts/[postId]/reactions**
```typescript
interface ReactionsResponse {
  reactions: ReactionSummary[];
  userReactions: string[]; // Emojis current user has reacted with
  totalCount: number;
}
```

### **Real-time Events**
```typescript
// Socket.IO event structure
interface ReactionUpdateEvent {
  type: 'reaction_update';
  postId?: number;
  commentId?: number;
  reactions: ReactionSummary[];
  userId: string; // Who reacted
  emoji: string;
  action: 'add' | 'remove';
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### **Performance Optimizations**
1. **Aggregated Queries**: Pre-calculate reaction counts for popular content
2. **Caching**: Redis cache for reaction summaries on hot posts
3. **Pagination**: Limit reaction user lists to prevent large payloads
4. **Debouncing**: Prevent rapid-fire reaction spam

### **Security Measures**
1. **Rate Limiting**: Max 10 reactions per user per minute
2. **Emoji Validation**: Only allow curated emoji set
3. **Gating Enforcement**: Proper write permission checks
4. **Community Scoping**: Users can only react within their community

### **Mobile Considerations**
1. **Touch-friendly**: Large reaction buttons for mobile
2. **Emoji Picker**: Native mobile emoji keyboard integration
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Subtle vibration on successful reaction
4. **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe right to quick-react with üëç

## Success Metrics

### **Engagement Metrics**
- **Reaction Rate**: % of posts/comments that receive reactions
- **Reaction Diversity**: Distribution across different emojis
- **User Participation**: % of users who react vs just read
- **Session Length**: Do reactions increase time spent in app?

### **Community Health**
- **Positive Sentiment**: Ratio of positive (üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüéâ) to negative (üò†üò¢) reactions
- **Content Quality**: Do posts with more reactions get more comments?
- **User Retention**: Do users with reaction activity return more often?

## Risks & Mitigations

### **Technical Risks**
- **Database Load**: Reactions could generate high write volume
  - *Mitigation*: Efficient indexing, reaction aggregation
- **Real-time Scaling**: Socket.IO reaction events at scale
  - *Mitigation*: Event batching, selective broadcasting

### **Product Risks**
- **Reaction Spam**: Users over-reacting to everything
  - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting, reaction limits per content
- **Negative Reactions**: üò†üò¢ could create toxic environment
  - *Mitigation*: Community guidelines, moderation tools

### **User Experience Risks**
- **Feature Confusion**: Users unclear on difference between votes vs reactions
  - *Mitigation*: Clear UI distinction, tooltips explaining each system
- **Engagement Fragmentation**: Split between voting and reacting
  - *Mitigation*: Monitor usage patterns, optimize UI placement

## Recommended Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions** (This Week)
1. **Create Migration File**: Database schema for reactions table
2. **Fix Upvote Gating Bug**: Add proper write permission checks to existing votes
3. **Prototype Reaction Bar**: Basic UI component with curated emoji set
4. **API Endpoint Design**: Draft the reaction API contract

### **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Implement Phase 1**: Core reactions system with proper gating integration
2. **Dual System Integration**: Reactions UI alongside existing vote buttons
3. **Basic Real-time**: Socket.IO integration for live reaction updates
4. **User Testing**: Get feedback from community on dual engagement system

### **Medium Term** (Next Month)
1. **Production Deployment**: Roll out to live community
2. **Monitor Engagement**: Track reaction usage patterns
3. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: Adjust emoji set, UI improvements
4. **Performance Optimization**: Based on real usage data

## Questions for Decision

1. **System Relationship**: How should reactions and votes be visually distinguished in the UI?
2. **Emoji Set**: Start with 8 curated emojis or allow custom reactions?
3. **Gating Scope**: Should reactions respect same gating as comments, or be more permissive?
4. **Real-time Priority**: How important are instant reaction updates vs eventual consistency?
5. **Analytics Depth**: Basic counts or detailed reaction analytics for community insights?

## üö® CRITICAL PRE-WORK: Fix Upvoting Gating Bug

**Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Must be fixed before emoji reactions  
**Impact**: Security vulnerability allowing unauthorized engagement  

### **Current Issue**
The existing upvote system has a **critical security gap**:
- Only checks `canUserAccessBoard()` (read permissions)  
- **Missing**: Board write permission checks (lock gating verification)
- **Result**: Users can upvote posts they can't comment on

### **Scope of Fix**
Update `/api/posts/[postId]/votes/route.ts` to match the gating pattern used in:
- `/api/posts/[postId]/comments/route.ts` (comment creation)
- `/api/posts/route.ts` (post creation)

### **Required Changes**
1. **Add board lock gating check** after existing board access check
2. **Query user verification status** for required locks
3. **Apply fulfillment logic** (ANY vs ALL) based on board settings
4. **Block voting** if verification requirements not met
5. **Consistent error messages** matching comment/post creation patterns

### **Implementation Pattern**
```typescript
// After existing canUserAccessBoard check:
const boardLockGating = SettingsUtils.getBoardLockGating(boardSettings);

if (boardLockGating && boardLockGating.lockIds.length > 0) {
  // Check user's verification status for required locks
  const verificationResult = await query(`
    SELECT lock_id FROM pre_verifications 
    WHERE user_id = $1 AND lock_id IN (...) 
      AND verification_status = 'verified' AND expires_at > NOW()
  `, [userId, ...boardLockGating.lockIds]);
  
  const verifiedCount = verificationResult.rows.length;
  const hasAccess = boardLockGating.fulfillment === 'any'
    ? verifiedCount >= 1
    : verifiedCount >= boardLockGating.lockIds.length;
    
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'This board requires verification before you can vote',
      requiresVerification: true 
    }, { status: 403 });
  }
}
```

### **Benefits of Fixing First**
1. **Security consistency**: All engagement respects same gating rules
2. **User experience**: Voting and commenting permissions align  
3. **Foundation prep**: Emoji reactions can inherit same gating logic
4. **No breaking changes**: Backward compatible with existing functionality

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours including testing  
**Risk Level**: Low - additive security check, no data migration required
