# **Universal Profile Connection Issues in Lock Creation Preview Modal – Full Analysis and Debugging Guide**

## **🎯 Core Problem Statement**

The **Universal Profile connection** feature in the lock creation preview modal is malfunctioning in several ways. Specifically, three intertwined issues were observed:

1. **Modal Closes on Connect:** Clicking the "Connect Universal Profile" button unexpectedly closes the entire lock creation modal (instead of simply prompting the connection).
2. **Button Disappears After Connect:** Upon a successful Universal Profile connection, the connect button vanishes entirely, rather than showing a "verification" or completion state.
3. **Button Missing Initially:** In some cases, the "Connect Universal Profile" button does not render at all when the modal loads.

These issues do not occur for the Ethereum profile connection (which serves as a baseline for expected behavior).

## **🏗️ Technical Architecture Context**

The lock creation preview modal leverages a gating system with different profile types. Key components involved include:

* **`GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx`** – The main preview modal component that lists gating categories (e.g., Universal Profile, Ethereum profile) and their connection buttons.
* **`UniversalProfileRenderer.tsx`** – Renderer responsible for handling Universal Profile (UP) connection UI and logic.
* **`EthereumProfileRenderer.tsx`** – Renderer for Ethereum wallet connections (this component is **working correctly** and provides a reference for expected behavior).
* **`ConditionalUniversalProfileProvider.tsx`** – A context provider that toggles between an inactive and active UP provider context. Originally, this was used to manage the Universal Profile connection context by switching providers when needed.

**Key Files Modified in Recent Fixes:**

* `src/components/locks/GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx` – Adjusted to handle UP connections via local state instead of context switching.
* `src/lib/gating/renderers/UniversalProfileRenderer.tsx` – Adjusted the button behavior logic for UP to match Ethereum’s logic.
* `src/types/lukso.d.ts` – TypeScript declarations for the `window.lukso` object (the provider injected by the LUKSO Universal Profile browser extension).

**Context on LUKSO Universal Profile:** The Universal Profile browser extension injects a provider at `window.lukso` in the webpage (analogous to how MetaMask injects `window.ethereum`). This provider allows dApps to request accounts and interact with the LUKSO blockchain. (Notably, LUKSO’s mainnet uses chain ID 42 – the same numeric ID previously used by Ethereum’s Kovan testnet – which explains the `chainId: 42` seen in connection logs.) The recommended approach for multi-wallet support is **EIP-6963**, which standardizes discovery of multiple injected providers. DApps not yet using EIP-6963 can still directly target the Universal Profile extension via `window.lukso`, which is the approach we use here.

## **📊 Problem Progression & Solutions Attempted**

This section chronicles each issue, symptoms, root causes, and solutions implemented:

### **Issue 1: Modal Closes When Clicking "Connect Universal Profile"**

* **Symptoms:** When the user clicks the "Connect Universal Profile" button in the modal, the **entire lock creation modal closes**. The expected behavior is that the modal remains open while the Universal Profile extension prompt appears (similar to how the Ethereum connection works, which does *not* close the modal). This only happened for the UP connection; Ethereum’s connect button did not trigger the modal to close.

* **Root Cause:** The modal closure was triggered by the way the Universal Profile context was being activated. In `GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx`, the code was calling `upActivation.initializeConnection()` when the button was clicked, which in turn switched the context provider via `ConditionalUniversalProfileProvider`. This context provider swap (from an `InactiveUPContextProvider` to an `ActiveUPContextProvider`) caused React to **unmount and remount** components in the modal. Essentially, toggling the context provider reset the component tree, closing the modal as a side effect.

  ```typescript
  // (Before) Excerpt from GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx that caused modal closure:
  if (!upActivation.hasUserTriggeredConnection) {
    upActivation.initializeConnection();
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  }
  ```

  **Technical Explanation:** When the context provider was toggled, the modal component (as part of the provider’s subtree) was unmounted. This is a known behavior: changing a high-level context provider will remount child components, thus any modal or UI under that context can lose its state. In this case, the act of initializing the UP connection via context caused the modal component to reset.

* **Solution Implemented:** We **bypassed the context provider system entirely** for the preview modal. Instead of relying on `ConditionalUniversalProfileProvider` to manage state, we introduced local state within the modal component to track the Universal Profile connection. The approach was to treat the Universal Profile similar to another wallet connector using Wagmi (a web3 React library), targeting the `window.lukso` provider directly.

  **Key changes:**

  * Added local state in `GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx` to track UP connection status (`isConnected` and connected `address`). This state persists within the modal component regardless of context changes.

  * Removed any calls to `upActivation.initializeConnection()` or context switching. This prevents the modal from unmounting.

  * Configured a Wagmi **injected connector** that explicitly targets `window.lukso` (the Universal Profile provider) instead of the default `window.ethereum`. Wagmi’s `injected` connector allows specifying a custom provider via the `target` option. We used this to ensure the connection flow exclusively engages the UP extension:

    ```typescript
    const upConfig = createConfig({
      chains: [luksoMainnet],
      connectors: [
        injected({
          target() {
            // Use LUKSO's injected provider if available
            if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).lukso) {
              return {
                id: 'universalProfile',
                name: 'Universal Profile',
                provider: (window as any).lukso,
              };
            }
            return { id: 'universalProfile', name: 'Universal Profile', provider: null };
          },
        }),
      ],
      transports: {
        [luksoMainnet.id]: http(),
      },
    });
    ```

    *Rationale:* This configuration sets up a connector that looks for `window.lukso` and uses it as the provider. The Wagmi library supports custom injected providers, as shown in its documentation (e.g., targeting a generic `window.ethereum` or other injected objects). By doing this, clicking "Connect Universal Profile" will call Wagmi’s connect on the UP extension without involving our context provider.

  * With this change, when the user clicks the connect button, the Universal Profile browser extension prompt is triggered (the extension pops up asking for connection permission) and **the modal remains open** in the background. This mirrors the Ethereum connection behavior.

* **Result:** ✅ The modal no longer closes when initiating a Universal Profile connection. The Universal Profile extension opens as expected, and the app awaits the connection response while keeping the preview modal on screen. This resolved the modal closure issue.

  *(Note: The direct use of `window.lukso` is a valid approach for engaging the Universal Profile extension, as official LUKSO docs indicate it’s the fallback provider name for the UP extension. In the future, implementing EIP-6963 would be ideal for multi-wallet support, but for now this direct connection ensures only the UP extension is targeted, not other wallets.)*

### **Issue 2: Connect Button Disappears After Successful Connection**

* **Symptoms:** After successfully connecting a Universal Profile (i.e., the extension returns an account address and chainId), the UI updates some state (we saw a log `UP connection result: { accounts: [...], chainId: 42 }`). The local state is updated with the connected address (e.g., `0x0a60...Da92` in logs). The expected behavior at this point (based on how Ethereum works) is for the button area to show a **"Preview Complete ✓"** status, indicating that the connection was made in preview mode (and perhaps allow verification if needed). Instead, what happened is the "Connect Universal Profile" button element disappeared entirely from the UI, leaving a blank space.

* **Root Cause:** The logic that determines what to display after connection was flawed in the UniversalProfileRenderer. By comparing it to the EthereumProfileRenderer (which was working correctly), we found that the Universal Profile variant had an extra condition that caused the button to be hidden/disabled incorrectly in preview mode.

  In UniversalProfileRenderer, the button component had a prop like:

  ```tsx
  disabled={
    isVerifying || 
    (!allRequirementsMet && verificationState === 'idle') || 
    (isPreviewMode && allRequirementsMet)
  }
  ```

  The last part of that condition – `|| (isPreviewMode && allRequirementsMet)` – would disable the button when in preview mode and all requirements are met. In the context of **preview mode** (`isPreviewMode = true`) and after connecting, `allRequirementsMet` would likely be true (if the requirement was simply to have a connected UP). This meant as soon as the UP was connected (thus requirement met), the button became disabled. Coupled with conditional rendering logic, it resulted in the button not rendering the expected "Preview Complete" state.

  By contrast, the EthereumProfileRenderer had a more nuanced approach. In Ethereum’s case, when in preview mode and the requirement is met, it doesn’t remove the button. Instead, it shows a non-interactive state indicating completion. The Ethereum renderer likely had something like:

  ```tsx
  {isPreviewMode && allRequirementsMet ? (
      // Show "Preview Complete ✓" with a check icon
  ) : (
      // Show regular connect or verifying states
  )}
  ```

  This ensures the button remains visible with a completed state.

* **Solution Implemented:** We adjusted the UniversalProfileRenderer’s logic to mirror the Ethereum renderer’s behavior:

  * Removed or modified the condition that was disabling/hiding the button on preview completion. Specifically, we **removed** the `(isPreviewMode && allRequirementsMet)` check from the `disabled` prop (and any similar checks in rendering).
  * Ensured that if `isPreviewMode` is true and the requirements are met (i.e., the UP connection is established), the render output displays a disabled button with the label **"Preview Complete ✓"** along with a checkmark icon (just like the Ethereum preview does).

  After the fix, the relevant JSX for the button looks like:

  ```jsx
  <Button
    /* ...other props... */
    disabled={isVerifying || (!allRequirementsMet && verificationState === 'idle')}
  >
    {isPreviewMode && allRequirementsMet ? (
      <>
        <CheckCircle className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
        Preview Complete ✓
      </>
    ) : (
      /* ...handle other states: idle text, verifying text, etc... */
    )}
  </Button>
  ```

  This way, once a Universal Profile is connected during preview, `isPreviewMode` is true and `allRequirementsMet` becomes true, so the button’s content switches to **"Preview Complete ✓"**. The button is disabled to indicate no further action is needed in the preview (matching Ethereum’s “Preview Complete” state), but it remains visible to the user with the checkmark confirmation.

* **Result:** ✅ After a successful UP connection, the button now remains in the UI and shows a **gray disabled button with "Preview Complete ✓"** and a check icon. This exactly matches the Ethereum profile flow for preview mode. The user now receives visual feedback that the connection step is complete in the preview.

### **Issue 3: "Connect Universal Profile" Button Missing on Modal Open (Current Outstanding Issue)**

* **Symptoms:** In some scenarios, when the lock creation preview modal is opened, the **"Connect Universal Profile" button does not appear at all** under the Universal Profile category. The entire section for Universal Profile might appear collapsed or empty, making it impossible for the user to initiate the connection. In effect, the user cannot even attempt to connect their Universal Profile because the UI element is not there. This seems intermittent or configuration-dependent, as other times the button does show up.

* **Investigation so Far:** This issue is currently under active debugging. We suspect it is related to how the **category is rendered and expanded** in the preview modal:

  The preview modal supports multiple categories (Ethereum, Universal Profile, etc.) but only shows the connection UI for the currently **expanded** category. Typically, if multiple gating categories are enabled, the first one is auto-expanded. If the Universal Profile category is enabled and is either the only category or the first in the list, it should auto-expand and show its connect UI.

  **Areas to check:**

  1. **Category Configuration and Enabling:** We need to verify that the gating configuration (`gatingConfig`) indeed includes the Universal Profile category and marks it as `enabled: true`. In `GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx`, the code maps `gatingConfig.categories` to an array of `CategoryStatus` objects, filtering those with `enabled: true`. If for some reason the Universal Profile category is not enabled (or missing) in the config, it would be filtered out and its button would never render. We should confirm the structure of `gatingConfig` passed in. For example, we expect something like:

     ```js
     gatingConfig = {
       categories: [
         { type: 'universal_profile', enabled: true, requirements: {...} },
         // ...other categories
       ],
       requireAll: false  // etc.
     }
     ```

     If `enabled` is false or the category object isn’t present, that’s a problem. It’s also worth ensuring that the Universal Profile requirements are properly structured (even if empty array) because an undefined `requirements` might cause the renderer to misbehave.

  2. **Auto-Expansion Logic:** The component uses a React effect to auto-expand the first enabled category on initial render:

     ```tsx
     React.useEffect(() => {
       if (enabledCategories.length > 0 && expandedCategory === null) {
         setExpandedCategory(enabledCategories[0].type);
       }
     }, [enabledCategories, expandedCategory]);
     ```

     We need to ensure this effect runs and that `expandedCategory` gets set to `"universal_profile"` (assuming that is the first enabled category). If `expandedCategory` remains `null`, the category panel might stay collapsed, hiding the content (including the connect button). Potential reasons the effect might fail:

     * If `enabledCategories` is empty or not containing the UP category at first render (maybe due to asynchronous data loading of gatingConfig).
     * If `expandedCategory` was somehow initialized to a non-null value or remembered from a previous state (though in preview it should start null).
     * A race condition where the effect runs before categories are loaded.

     Logging the values of `enabledCategories` and `expandedCategory` on render will help diagnose this:

     ```tsx
     console.log('[DEBUG] enabledCategories:', enabledCategories);
     console.log('[DEBUG] expandedCategory:', expandedCategory);
     ```

     We expect to see `enabledCategories` containing an entry for `universal_profile` and then `expandedCategory` being set to `"universal_profile"`.

  3. **Renderer Registration:** The gating system likely uses a registry to map category types to their renderer components. In the code, there is typically a function like `ensureRegistered(category.type)` that returns the appropriate renderer. We should verify that `'universal_profile'` is indeed registered and returning the `UniversalProfileRenderer` component. If the registry doesn’t have the entry, the render call might be returning null, thus nothing is shown. Checking if `window.__gatingRegistry` (or equivalent) has an entry for `universal_profile` could be useful for debugging:

     ```js
     console.log('Registry keys:', Object.keys(window.__gatingRegistry || {}));
     ```

     We expect to see `'universal_profile'` in the keys.

  4. **Renderer Rendering Logic:** Assuming the renderer is found, the code calls `renderer.renderConnection(...)` to get the JSX for the connect UI. If that function returns null or encounters an error, the UI would be blank. We should ensure that the props passed to `renderConnection` are correct. For preview, we expect something like:

     ```tsx
     renderer.renderConnection({
       requirements: category.requirements,
       onConnect: handleConnect,
       onDisconnect: handleDisconnect,
       userStatus: mockUserStatus,
       disabled: false,
       postId: -1,
       isPreviewMode: true
     });
     ```

     Any mismatch in these props could cause the renderer to decide not to show the button. For example, if `requirements` are empty and the renderer expects something, or if `userStatus.connected` is already true when it shouldn’t be, the renderer might think no button is needed. We saw from logs that `mockUserStatus` was used to simulate the user's connection state in preview. Initially, it should be `{ connected: false, verified: false, requirements: [] }` for an unconnected state. We should double-check that this is indeed the case at first render.

* **Next Steps (Debugging Plan):** To systematically find why the button sometimes doesn’t show, we propose:

  1. **Add Detailed Logging** in the relevant parts of `GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx` and `UniversalProfileRenderer.tsx`:

     ```tsx
     // At the top of GatingRequirementsPreview component
     console.log('[DEBUG] GatingRequirementsPreview props:', gatingConfig);
     console.log('[DEBUG] Categories count:', gatingConfig.categories?.length);

     // After computing enabledCategories and expandedCategory
     console.log('[DEBUG] enabledCategories:', enabledCategories);
     console.log('[DEBUG] expandedCategory (state):', expandedCategory);

     // Inside the render loop for categories:
     enabledCategories.forEach(category => {
       console.log('[DEBUG] Rendering category:', category.type, 
                   'enabled=', category.enabled, 
                   'expandedCategory=', expandedCategory);
     });

     // Before calling ensureRegistered and renderConnection
     console.log('[DEBUG] About to ensure renderer for:', category.type);
     const renderer = ensureRegistered(category.type);
     console.log('[DEBUG] Got renderer:', renderer ? renderer.name : renderer);
     if (renderer) {
       console.log('[DEBUG] renderConnection exists:', typeof renderer.renderConnection);
       console.log('[DEBUG] Calling renderConnection for', category.type);
     }
     ```

     And similarly in `UniversalProfileRenderer.renderConnection`, log the inputs:

     ```tsx
     console.log('[DEBUG] [UP Renderer] isPreviewMode:', isPreviewMode, 'userStatus:', userStatus);
     console.log('[DEBUG] [UP Renderer] requirements:', requirements);
     ```

     These logs will show whether the function is even invoked and what data it's using.

  2. **Verify Gating Config Upstream:** Ensure that when the modal is opened, the data passed into it includes the Universal Profile requirement properly. If the gating configuration is built elsewhere (perhaps based on the lock settings), confirm that the Universal Profile category is marked enabled when it’s supposed to. It might be necessary to trace how `gatingConfig` is formed. If a feature flag or condition controls the presence of the UP category, ensure it’s set.

  3. **Compare with Ethereum Flow:** The Ethereum profile connection always shows its button. By comparing the flow, we might find something like:

     * The Ethereum category might always be included by default (enabled or not).
     * Perhaps the Ethereum renderer registers itself unconditionally, whereas the UP renderer might only register if some context is present.
     * The UI might treat the first category differently if it's the only one.
       We should mirror the Ethereum handling for Universal Profile as much as possible. For instance, if Ethereum’s gatingConfig always has an entry, ensure UP’s does too if needed.

  4. **Test Different Scenarios:** Try opening the modal in various scenarios:

     * With only Universal Profile required (no Ethereum category).
     * With multiple categories (UP and Ethereum both enabled).
     * Rapidly toggling something if possible (though in preview it might be static).
       Observe if the "Connect Universal Profile" button consistently appears. If it only fails when it’s the only category, the issue could be in how the component chooses to auto-expand or render a single category (maybe it expects at least two categories?).

* **Goal:** The "Connect Universal Profile" button should **always be visible** when the gating requirement includes a Universal Profile. It should render by default and auto-expand if it’s the first/only category, so the user can immediately see the option to connect. Fixing this will likely involve either correcting the gatingConfig input or adjusting the component logic to not depend on some external context (since we removed the context, maybe some flag that was toggled by context is now not set, causing the UI to skip showing the button).

At this stage, Issue 3 is not fully resolved, but the above steps form a plan to pinpoint the cause. We suspect a minor oversight like the category not being flagged as enabled or a conditional rendering that needs tweaking.

## **🔍 Known Working Solutions & References**

Before finalizing the fix for Issue 3, it’s helpful to note known good implementations and patterns:

* **Ethereum Profile Connection (Reference):** The EthereumProfileRenderer and related logic in the gating preview are functioning correctly. Key behaviors:

  * The "Connect Wallet" button for Ethereum always appears when Ethereum gating is enabled.
  * Clicking it opens MetaMask (or the default `window.ethereum` provider) without closing the modal.
  * After connecting (in preview mode), the button changes to "Preview Complete ✓" and is disabled.
  * The component manages state internally (likely using Wagmi under the hood as well) and doesn’t unmount the modal on connect.
  * We should ensure the Universal Profile flow mirrors this behavior. Our fixes in Issue 1 and 2 were aimed at achieving parity with Ethereum’s flow.

* **Direct UP Connection Approach:** We implemented a direct connection approach using Wagmi’s `injected` connector with a custom provider target. This is a known approach for custom wallet providers. In fact, Wagmi’s documentation shows how to target a specific `window` provider by returning a custom object with an `id`, `name`, and `provider`. Our use of `window.lukso` aligns with this pattern. Moreover, the LUKSO team’s guidance (pre-EIP-6963) is to use `window.lukso` to detect the UP extension, confirming that our method is appropriate.

* **Previous UP Implementation vs New:** Initially, the app attempted to use a context provider (`ConditionalUniversalProfileProvider`) to manage UP connections. This proved problematic in a modal context. The new implementation simplifies this by using local state and direct connection calls. This approach is more self-contained and less prone to side effects like unmounting. Many dApps handle wallet connections (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) via direct calls in a component or a custom hook, rather than swapping context providers on the fly. Our solution follows this common design for the UP extension as well.

## **🛠️ Current State & Next Steps**

After applying fixes for Issue 1 and 2, the system is partly fixed but not fully stable for Universal Profile connections. Here’s the current state and what remains:

* **State of Fixes:**

  * *Modal Closure:* Resolved by removing context switching. Modal stays open during UP connect.
  * *Post-Connect UI:* Resolved by adjusting renderer logic. "Preview Complete ✓" now displays after connecting.
  * *Initial Button Render:* Still unreliable – needs fixing.

* **Files to Focus On:**

  * `GatingRequirementsPreview.tsx` – Ensure it correctly initializes and renders the UP category section. The expansion logic and `handleConnect` method here are crucial.
  * `UniversalProfileRenderer.tsx` – Ensure `renderConnection` handles all states (initial, connecting, connected in preview, etc.). It should return the proper JSX for each state.
  * Any state or context related to gating – Since we removed the context dependency, double-check if any leftover context checks or flags might interfere. For example, if something like `upActivation.isActive` was used to decide rendering, that may need removal or replacement with our local state.

* **Next Steps:**

  1. Implement the logging and debugging plan outlined in Issue 3’s analysis to capture what happens when the modal opens.

  2. Run the application in development (`yarn dev`) and reproduce the scenario where the UP button is missing. Collect logs.

  3. Adjust code based on findings:

     * If the category is not present or enabled, fix the data feeding into the modal.
     * If the expansion state is not set, possibly force the Universal Profile category open by default (especially if it’s the only category).
     * If the renderer is not being called, ensure `ensureRegistered('universal_profile')` is executed and the registry is initialized. It may be that the registry initialization (perhaps done in `GatingCategories` component or similar) is conditioned on something.
     * If the `renderConnection` returns nothing, inspect the conditions inside `UniversalProfileRenderer.renderConnection`.

  4. Test again after adjustments. Use the success criteria below as a checklist.

* **Consider Edge Cases:** The UP extension might not be installed – in that case, the connect button should ideally prompt installation or show an error (currently, our code might just do nothing if `window.lukso` is missing). Also, if both Ethereum and UP are required (requireAll = true scenario), ensure the UI can handle connecting both and showing both statuses.

## **✅ Success Criteria**

To declare this issue fully resolved, all of the following should be true:

* **Initial Render:** The "Connect Universal Profile" button **always appears** whenever the Universal Profile gating category is enabled for a lock. It should be visible without requiring any extra clicks (auto-expanded if it’s the sole or first category).
* **Dedicated Connection:** Clicking the UP connect button triggers **only** the Universal Profile browser extension pop-up (i.e., it should not open MetaMask or other wallet prompts). This ensures a user with both MetaMask and UP extension isn’t confused – it should target UP specifically.
* **Modal Persistence:** The lock creation preview modal remains open and interactive while the UP connection flow is in progress. No accidental closures or navigation occur.
* **Post-Connection UI:** After a successful connection, the UI in the modal updates to show the **"Preview Complete ✓"** state for the Universal Profile category, analogous to Ethereum. The button may be disabled in this state (since in preview there’s no further action), but it remains visible with the checkmark confirmation.
* **State Consistency:** The app’s internal state (or `mockUserStatus`) should reflect `connected: true` for the Universal Profile after connection, and this state should persist for the duration of the preview modal. If the user disconnects or closes the modal, state should reset appropriately without errors.
* **No Regressions:** The Ethereum profile flow continues to work as before (our changes shouldn’t affect it). Additionally, other gating categories (if any) still function normally.

By meeting all the above, the Universal Profile connection feature will be on par with the Ethereum connection feature in terms of user experience.

## **💡 Recommended Approach for the New Agent**

For a developer or agent picking up this issue now, here is a step-by-step approach to tackle the remaining problem (Issue 3) and verify the entire solution:

1. **Reproduce and Observe:** Start the app and open the gating requirements preview modal for a lock that requires a Universal Profile. Note whether the connect button appears. Open the browser’s console to catch any debug logs or errors related to rendering the category. This initial step is crucial to see the problem in action with the latest code.

2. **Inspect Gating Config and State:** Using the console or React Developer Tools, inspect the `GatingRequirementsPreview` component’s props and state:

   * Ensure `gatingConfig.categories` contains an entry for `universal_profile` with `enabled: true`.
   * Check the state for `expandedCategory` in the component – is it `"universal_profile"` or `null`?
   * Inspect `mockUserStatus` (or whatever user status is being passed to the renderer) to confirm it starts as not connected.

3. **Add Debug Logs:** If not already done, insert the console logs as described above in the code, especially around where the category is rendered and where `renderConnection` is invoked. Then reload the modal and examine the console output to pinpoint where the flow breaks. For example, if you see:

   ```
   [DEBUG] enabledCategories: [] 
   ```

   then you know the category isn't being enabled properly. Or if you see:

   ```
   [DEBUG] About to ensure renderer for: universal_profile
   [DEBUG] Got renderer: undefined
   ```

   then the registry failed to provide a renderer.

4. **Compare with Ethereum Category:** Open a case where an Ethereum profile is required (or both Ethereum and UP). Look at the component’s behavior:

   * Does `expandedCategory` default to the first category (which might be Ethereum if it’s listed first)? If so, maybe the logic always picks Ethereum because of array order. Ensure that if UP is present and Ethereum is not, UP becomes the first.
   * Check how the Ethereum renderer is registered. Possibly there’s an initialization step (maybe in a higher-level component or a registry setup) where both `ethereum_profile` and `universal_profile` should be registered. If the registration for UP is conditional and didn’t run (perhaps because we bypassed context), we might need to explicitly register it.

5. **Implement Fixes:**

   * If **category not enabled**: trace back to where `gatingConfig` comes from. Possibly adjust the logic that builds `gatingConfig` to ensure it marks the category as enabled when appropriate.
   * If **auto-expand fails**: we could force the issue by explicitly calling `setExpandedCategory('universal_profile')` if we detect that category is present. Alternatively, ensure the useEffect that sets the expanded category runs after the data is loaded. We might add a small timeout or a second effect that checks if not expanded and categories array now has elements.
   * If **renderer not registered**: find where the app registers gating category renderers. We may add a manual registration call as a quick fix. For example, if there’s a central registry object, do something like `registry.register('universal_profile', UniversalProfileRenderer)` on component mount if needed.
   * If **renderConnection returns null**: inspect the UniversalProfileRenderer code for any `if` conditions that might return nothing. Perhaps it expects `userStatus.requirements` to have certain shape. The `mockUserStatus.requirements` might be an empty array currently; confirm if Ethereum passes something similar. If needed, pass dummy requirement data or adjust the renderer to not require it for rendering the connect button.

6. **Test Rigorously:** After adjustments, test all combinations:

   * Only UP required
   * Only Ethereum required
   * Both UP and Ethereum required (with one or both needing connection)
   * Try connecting, disconnecting (if disconnect is an option in preview), re-opening the modal, etc.
   * Make sure the modal doesn’t throw errors in console (e.g., if `window.lukso` is undefined and user clicks connect, perhaps handle that gracefully with an alert or message like "Please install LUKSO Universal Profile extension").

7. **Code Cleanup:** Remove or conditionally compile out the console debug logs once the issue is resolved and the behavior is confirmed. Ensure any temporary logic (timeouts, forced expansions) are done in a clean way (comments explaining them if they’re workarounds).

By following these steps, the agent should be able to identify why the "Connect Universal Profile" button was not appearing and implement a robust fix. This approach emphasizes verifying each piece of the puzzle (data, state, rendering logic) and mirroring the known-good Ethereum flow.

## **🔗 Key Insights and Additional Context**

Here are some additional insights and context points uncovered during the analysis, which may help in understanding the bigger picture or future maintenance:

* **React Context vs Local State:** The initial design using `ConditionalUniversalProfileProvider` was likely intended to globally manage Universal Profile connections (perhaps to allow other parts of the app to know if a UP is connected). However, in a contained UI like a modal, flipping context providers can cause unintended unmounts. This is a general React quirk: changing the component tree (especially context providers or parent components) will remount children. The fix by using local state aligns with React best practices for modals – keep the state within the modal if the modal’s behavior is independent. We traded a bit of global context for simpler local control, which proved beneficial here. If a global state is needed (e.g., to show elsewhere that a UP is connected), one could still lift this state up to a global store or context *after* the modal succeeds, rather than during the connection attempt.

* **LUKSO Universal Profile Extension Behavior:** The Universal Profile browser extension injects `window.lukso` when installed. If multiple wallet extensions are installed (like MetaMask and Universal Profile), using the Wagmi `injected()` connector without a target might pick up the wrong one (usually MetaMask’s `window.ethereum`). By explicitly targeting `window.lukso`, we ensure the correct extension is engaged. LUKSO is aware of this multi-provider challenge; the introduction of **EIP-6963** addresses it by allowing dApps to list and choose between multiple injected providers. Although our current solution is a direct target (which is fine if we assume the user wants to connect a UP), a future improvement could be to support detection of both wallet types and present a choice to the user.

* **Chain and Network Considerations:** When connecting to the Universal Profile, the extension will likely connect to LUKSO’s network (mainnet or testnet depending on extension settings). The logs showed `chainId: 42` which corresponds to LUKSO mainnet. This means our app should be aware of LUKSO’s RPC or use a provider for it. In the Wagmi config snippet, we included `chains: [luksoMainnet]` and a transport. We should verify that `luksoMainnet` (and possibly `luksoTestnet` if needed) are defined in our chains configuration. If not, we might need to define a custom chain configuration with chain ID 42, RPC URL, block explorer, etc., or use a library that includes LUKSO chain definitions.

* **User Experience:** The ultimate goal is a smooth user experience:

  * The user opens the gating preview, sees clearly what they need to do (connect their profile).
  * They click connect, use the familiar browser extension flow, and get immediate feedback in the UI that it was successful.
  * They should not see any errors, blank areas, or need to refresh. Achieving this builds trust that the gating feature works reliably.
  * Additionally, if the user doesn’t have the UP extension and clicks the button, ideally we handle that (maybe we can detect `!window.lukso` and show a message "Please install LUKSO Universal Profile extension to continue"). This wasn’t explicitly in scope but is a nice-to-have safeguard.

* **Testing & Future Proofing:** Once Issue 3 is resolved, it would be wise to write some component tests or integration tests for this flow:

  * A test where we simulate a user clicking "Connect Universal Profile" and ensure the modal doesn’t unmount and that the state updates.
  * Perhaps mock the `window.lukso.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` call to simulate a successful connection and then verify the "Preview Complete ✓" appears.
  * Test that if `window.lukso` is absent, the UI could show an appropriate fallback (maybe the button could be disabled with tooltip "Extension not found", etc.).
  * Keeping these tests will prevent regressions if someone later refactors the context or gating system.

By incorporating these insights and following through with the debugging plan, the new agent should be equipped to fix the remaining issue and polish the Universal Profile connection feature. The end result will be a robust implementation where **Universal Profile connections work as seamlessly as Ethereum wallet connections** in the lock creation preview modal.
