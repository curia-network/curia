Great, I’ll gather the full implementation details and code-level guidance to support tipping in your Next.js app using Lukso Universal Profiles. This will include how to send LYX, LSP7, and LSP8 tokens based on a recipient’s UP name + address hash, as well as exploring smart contract-based escrow when a full address isn’t available.

I’ll provide clear examples and describe any APIs or libraries that may help with resolving identities and sending transactions. I’ll get back to you shortly with the findings.


# Implementing a Tipping System with LUKSO Universal Profiles

## Introduction

LUKSO’s Universal Profiles (UP) are smart contract-based profiles that users control and use as digital identities on the LUKSO blockchain. In a typical LUKSO dApp, users are identified by a human-readable name *plus* a short 4-hexadecimal identifier derived from their profile’s address (e.g. `@username#1234`). This naming convention uniquely distinguishes profiles that share similar names. Our goal is to enable a **tipping** feature in a Next.js application integrated with LUKSO Universal Profiles, allowing users to send on-chain assets (native **LYX** tokens, LSP7 fungible tokens, or LSP8 NFTs) to other users using only the recipient’s UP name and identifier (instead of a full address). We will explore how to: (1) retrieve the list of assets a user can tip from their UP wallet, (2) resolve a recipient’s UP address from their name#id, (3) perform transfers of LYX, LSP7 tokens, and LSP8 NFTs via the user’s Universal Profile, and (4) consider a fallback escrow mechanism if the recipient’s UP address cannot be immediately determined. Throughout, we leverage LUKSO’s tooling (e.g. **ERC725** storage, LSP contract standards, and the UP Browser Extension) to keep the solution non-custodial and user-controlled.

## Fetching a User’s Assets for Tipping

Each Universal Profile maintains an on-chain inventory of owned assets via the **LSP5-ReceivedAssets** standard. In practice, the UP smart contract stores a list of asset contract addresses (both fungible and NFT) in its ERC725Y storage. This means we can query the profile to get all token addresses it holds. For example, using the `erc725.js` library and the profile’s address, we can read the **`LSP5ReceivedAssets[]`** key to fetch an array of asset addresses. Once we have these addresses, we should determine the asset type: each token contract can be checked for LSP7 vs LSP8 interface support (via ERC-165 interface IDs). This tells us whether the asset is a fungible token (LSP7) or an NFT (LSP8), and we can then display an asset list to the user (including perhaps asset names or symbols by reading their LSP4 metadata). With the list of assets (and the user’s current LYX balance from the UP), the frontend can present choices like “LYX” or specific token names for the user to select as the tipping currency.

## Resolving a Recipient’s Universal Profile (Name#ID to Address)

Users will identify the tip recipient by their Universal Profile handle, which includes a username and a short identifier. **For example:** *“@charliebrown...#0Dc0” tipping to “@Frozeman#9750”* means the user “charliebrown...#0Dc0” (profile name *CharlieBrown* with address ending in `0Dc0`) is sending assets to the user “Frozeman#9750”. **Figure:** The LUKSO Universal Profile Browser Extension UI for transferring assets between two profiles by selecting a profile name and short identifier (e.g. “@charliebrown...#0Dc0” as sender and “@Frozeman#9750” as receiver). This interface shows a user sending **0.5 LYX** (the LUKSO native token, here on testnet as LYXt) and requires a long-press to confirm the transaction. The extension abstracts the smart contract calls, letting users transfer tokens with a UX similar to a regular wallet.

Internally, our dApp needs to **resolve the recipient’s profile name+ID to an actual address** in order to call the transfer. There are a few ways to achieve this:

* **GraphQL Indexer / Search API:** The LUKSO team provides indexing services (such as the “LUKSO Envio” indexer) that allow searching Universal Profiles by name or partial address. For example, projects like *LukUp* (a UP search tool) demonstrate the ability to find profiles by name, username, or even partial address matches. By querying such an index (via GraphQL or REST API), we can input the name “Frozeman” and possibly filter by address suffix “9750” to get the exact profile’s address. In a Next.js app, this could be done server-side or client-side by calling the indexer’s API. The result gives the **universal profile address** corresponding to the recipient’s handle.
* **Direct Lookup via Profile Data:** In theory, one could scan all profiles on-chain for a matching name, but this is inefficient without an index. Profile names and other info are stored in the profile’s LSP3 metadata JSON (often on IPFS), not directly on-chain, so an on-chain lookup by name is not straightforward. Thus, relying on an off-chain index or a cached mapping is preferable.
* **Caching Known Profiles:** If the application has its own database, it could maintain a mapping of username#id to addresses (by periodically pulling from the indexer or by registering users as they sign up/login with their UP). This could expedite resolution for known users. However, to stay decentralized and up-to-date, using the official indexer or a community index (like **universaleverything.io** or **universalprofile.cloud** backend) is recommended.

Using one of these methods, when a user enters a handle like “Frozeman#9750”, the app should call a function (possibly on the backend) that returns the target UP address (e.g. `0x02e655F92f01BC7880807ec409F134b91bb28381` as in LUKSO’s documentation examples). With the recipient’s address known, we can proceed to execute the token transfer.

## Sending LYX (Native LUKSO) Tips

Sending the native cryptocurrency (LYX) from a Universal Profile uses LUKSO’s **Key Manager** and **Relayer** under the hood, but the process is made to feel like a normal ETH transfer from a wallet. In our Next.js app, we rely on the **LUKSO Universal Profile Browser Extension** (similar to MetaMask but for UPs) which injects a web3 provider at `window.lukso`. This extension “magically” wraps transactions so that developers can use familiar web3 calls without manually crafting contract interactions. In practice, to send LYX:

1. **Connect to the UP extension’s provider:** For example, using **ethers.js**, we create a BrowserProvider and request accounts:

   ```js
   import { ethers } from 'ethers';
   const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.lukso);
   await provider.send('eth_requestAccounts', []);  // prompts connection
   const signer = await provider.getSigner();
   const upAddress = await signer.getAddress();  // our UP (sender) address
   ```

   This gives us a signer object that represents the user’s Universal Profile (controlled via the extension).

2. **Send a transaction:** Use the signer to send a standard transaction with `to` and `value`. For example:

   ```js
   const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({
     from: upAddress,                     // our UP (smart contract) address
     to: recipientAddress,               // target UP or any address
     value: ethers.parseEther('0.5'),    // amount in LYX (0.5 LYX in wei)
   });
   ```

   Under the hood, the extension intercepts this and will prompt the user to confirm sending 0.5 LYX from their profile. The LUKSO Relayer service likely handles the transaction execution via the profile’s Key Manager (so that the smart contract profile actually transfers the funds). For the developer, however, it works just like a normal ETH transfer call. The LUKSO docs confirm that *“simply use eth\_sendTransaction as you always did... the Browser Extension handles all of that behind the scene”*. In web3.js, it’s similar: call `web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: accounts[0], to: ..., value: ... })` using the injected `window.lukso` provider.

After the user confirms, the LYX transfer will be executed on-chain, moving the specified amount from the sender’s Universal Profile to the recipient’s address. Note that the recipient can be another Universal Profile *or* a regular externally-owned account (EOA); the extension will handle either case. The transaction receipt can be handled as usual (to show success/failure in the UI).

## Sending LSP7 Fungible Tokens as Tips

Transferring **LSP7 tokens** (fungible tokens on LUKSO, analogous to ERC20s but with extended features) is slightly different because we need to interact with the token contract’s functions. LSP7 tokens implement a **`transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bool force, bytes data)`** function. This function requires the caller to specify the sender address explicitly, since a third-party (like the UP’s Key Manager or controller) might be initiating the transfer. To send LSP7 tokens from our Universal Profile to another:

1. **Set up the contract instance:** We need the token contract’s ABI and address. LUKSO provides the ABIs in the `@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts` package. For example:

   ```js
   import LSP7DigitalAsset from '@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts/artifacts/LSP7DigitalAsset.json';
   const tokenAddress = '0x5b8b0e44d471...';       // the LSP7 token contract we want to send
   const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(tokenAddress, LSP7DigitalAsset.abi, signer);
   ```

   Here, `signer` is the same signer connected via `window.lukso` (our UP’s controller). Now `tokenContract` is a web3 contract object that we can call methods on.

2. **Call the transfer function:** Using ethers.js (similarly for web3.js with `tokenContract.methods.transfer().send()` syntax), we invoke the LSP7 transfer:

   ```js
   const amount = ethers.parseUnits('15', 18);  // e.g. 15 tokens, assuming 18 decimals
   await tokenContract.transfer(
     await signer.getAddress(),    // from: the UP’s address (sender)
     recipientAddress,            // to: recipient’s address (UP or EOA)
     amount,                      // amount: token amount in smallest units
     true,                        // force: true to allow sending to any address
     '0x'                         // data: optional data payload (none here)
   );
   ```

   A few things to note: The `from` parameter **must** equal our UP’s address (which it will, since we use `signer.getAddress()` to supply it). The extension will detect that the signer is controlling that UP and will prompt a signature. The **`force` flag** is set to `true` here to permit transfer to an address that might not implement any token receiver interface. If we set `force=false`, the transfer would only succeed if the recipient is a contract that implements LSP1 (universal receiver) – typically another UP. Using `true` is simpler for tipping use-cases, because it covers all recipient types. The `data` field can carry arbitrary bytes (for example, a message or tag); we leave it empty (`0x`).

   Additionally, we must handle token **decimals** correctly. Most LSP7 tokens will use 18 decimals (like Ether/LYX). The example above uses `ethers.parseUnits('15', 18)` to convert 15.0 tokens into the 18-decimal base unit (which results in the number `15000000000000000000` in wei). If a token uses a different decimals setting, or if the token is non-divisible (decimals = 0, e.g. certain NFTs issued as LSP7), we would adjust accordingly (e.g. pass a plain integer for amount). The LUKSO docs emphasize using the correct decimal conversion; otherwise, sending “8” when the token has 18 decimals would actually send an extremely tiny amount (8 \* 10^-18), which may not even register as a whole token.

After calling `transfer`, the extension will prompt the user to authorize sending that token. Once confirmed, the token contract’s internal logic will debit the sender’s balance and credit the recipient’s balance. Our app can listen for the transfer event or wait for the transaction to complete to update the UI (e.g. updating the asset list or showing a success message).

## Sending LSP8 NFT Assets as Tips

LUKSO’s **LSP8 Identifiable Digital Asset** standard is used for NFTs and unique tokens. Transferring an NFT under LSP8 is conceptually similar to LSP7, but the function signature uses a `tokenId` (a unique identifier for the token) instead of an amount. The function is **`transfer(address from, address to, bytes32 tokenId, bool force, bytes data)`**. To tip someone an NFT that your Universal Profile owns:

1. **Prepare the LSP8 contract instance:** Like before, use the LSP8 ABI from `@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts`. Example:

   ```js
   import LSP8IdentifiableDigitalAsset from '@lukso/lsp-smart-contracts/artifacts/LSP8IdentifiableDigitalAsset.json';
   const nftAddress = '0x86e817172b5c07f7036bf8aa46e2db9063743a83';  // the NFT collection contract
   const nftCollection = new ethers.Contract(nftAddress, LSP8IdentifiableDigitalAsset.abi, signer);
   ```

2. **Determine the Token ID:** In LSP8, each NFT’s ID is a 32-byte value. Often this can be derived from an integer token number or a hash. If we have a token number (say token #319 in the collection), we should convert it to a 32-byte hex string. For example, using ethers:

   ```js
   const tokenId = ethers.toBeHex(319, 32);  // pad 319 to 32 bytes, returns a 0x... hex string
   ```

   Alternatively, if the token IDs are already given as hex strings or UUIDs, use those directly (ensuring they are 32 bytes).

3. **Call the transfer:**

   ```js
   await nftCollection.transfer(
     await signer.getAddress(),   // from: our UP address
     recipientAddress,           // to: recipient UP or address
     tokenId,                    // tokenId: 32-byte identifier of the NFT
     true,                       // force: true to allow any address
     '0x'                        // data: none
   );
   ```

   This will invoke the NFT transfer. Just as with LSP7, the `from` must equal our profile’s address (which the extension verifies via the Key Manager permissions), and we set `force=true` so that the NFT can be sent even if the recipient hasn’t set up a universal receiver callback. The user will confirm the transaction through the UP extension. After execution, the ownership of that NFT (identified by `tokenId`) moves to the recipient’s address.

One thing to keep in mind: if the NFT collection is enumerable or if we maintain a list of NFTs in the user’s profile, we should update it on the frontend post-transfer. The profile’s `LSP5ReceivedAssets[]` list will also update (the NFT contract address might remain in the list if the user still has other tokens from that collection, or it might be removed if that was the only NFT from that collection). But immediate UI feedback can be based on the successful transaction and perhaps a refresh of profile data.

## Full-Stack Implementation Considerations

Implementing the above in a **Next.js** full-stack app involves coordinating the frontend (React) with possible backend services:

* **Frontend (Next.js React):** The frontend will handle most of the interaction: connecting to the user’s wallet (UP extension), fetching their profile data (via `erc725.js` or a GraphQL query to get assets and profile info), and initiating transfers when the user submits a tip. Next.js can securely include environment variables for any API keys needed (e.g. if using a GraphQL endpoint that requires a key). Since the user’s private keys never leave the UP browser extension, all signing must be done client-side. The front-end code (as shown in snippets above) will trigger the extension pop-ups for sending transactions. After a transfer, the front-end can optimistically update the UI or wait for confirmation via the provider.

* **Backend (Node.js API routes or server):** The backend can play a role in looking up profile addresses from names, especially if using a private API key for an indexer. For example, the Next.js server could expose an endpoint `/api/resolve-profile?handle=Frozeman#9750` which queries the LUKSO indexer or subgraph, then returns the address. This keeps API keys secret and allows caching results. The backend can also log tip transactions for analytic or notification purposes (e.g. store in a database that user X tipped user Y amount Z at time T). However, the backend **should not** ever hold users’ keys or directly move funds – all fund movements are on-chain and user-signed, preserving a non-custodial model.

  * If the application wants to provide extra features like notifying the recipient (off-chain) about a tip, the backend could handle that (e.g. send an email or a push notification when it detects a certain on-chain event or when the tipper explicitly leaves a message). Such features would require the backend to either listen to blockchain events (via WebSockets or periodic checks) or to be informed by the frontend when a tip is sent.
  * **Security:** Since tipping involves value transfer, ensure the frontend is loading the correct recipient address (to avoid phishing). Using the official indexer or verifying the resolved address (perhaps showing part of it to the user for confirmation) can help avoid sending to the wrong address in case of name collisions.

Overall, the heavy lifting of *transacting* is done by the user’s Universal Profile smart contract and the extension – our app mostly orchestrates user intent (choose asset, choose recipient, sign transaction). The LUKSO infrastructure (ERC725Y data, LSP7/LSP8 standards, Key Manager, Relayer) abstracts complex Ethereum interactions into simpler web3 calls as we demonstrated.

## Escrowed Tipping for Unknown Recipients (Advanced Scenario)

What if a user wants to tip someone, but we cannot find that person’s Universal Profile address? Perhaps the intended recipient hasn’t created a profile yet, or the tipper only knows a nickname that isn’t registered on LUKSO. In such cases, a direct transfer is not possible. We might consider an **escrow-based tipping system** where the funds are locked on-chain until the recipient comes forward to claim them. While implementing this is complex, here are some research insights and ideas:

* **On-Chain Escrow Contract:** We could deploy a *TippingEscrow* smart contract on the LUKSO network. When user A wants to tip “Alice#0000” but no address is known, user A would call the escrow contract (via their UP) to deposit the funds and specify an identifier for the recipient. The identifier could be a plaintext name or an ID, but storing a raw name on-chain is expensive and comparing strings on-chain is hard. Instead, we might store a **hash** of the intended identifier or some unique reference. The funds would then be held in the contract’s balance under that hash. The contract would define a function for claiming tips, which only the rightful “Alice” can trigger.

* **Proving Identity to Claim:** The biggest challenge is **proving that a given user is the intended recipient** without an existing on-chain identity. One approach is to leverage off-chain verification with oracles. For example, the escrow contract could accept a claim if accompanied by a cryptographic proof or an attestation from a trusted oracle: The oracle could verify off-chain that the user claiming to be Alice has authenticated with a known account (email, social, etc.) that the tipper associated with that name. The oracle (which itself is a smart contract key controlled by our backend or a service like Chainlink) would then call the escrow contract to release funds to the user’s provided UP address. Essentially, the oracle serves as a bridge, bringing external authentication data on-chain to satisfy the escrow’s conditions. Using such an oracle means introducing a trusted third party, which blockchain purists aim to avoid. Indeed, oracles *“somewhat go against the founding principle”* of trustless systems because you must trust the oracle’s honesty. We could mitigate this by using a well-known decentralized oracle network or by requiring multiple independent attestations (to minimize the risk of a single oracle’s false data). But these add cost and complexity.

* **Alternate Claim Mechanisms:** If we wanted to avoid off-chain entirely, we could tie claims to *on-chain events*. For instance, if the “name” in question corresponds to a **Universal Page Name NFT** (LUKSO has the concept of reserving profile names via NFTs, as hinted by `lukso.page/<yourname>`), the contract could specify that *whoever owns the NFT for “Alice”* can claim the funds. However, if the name NFT wasn’t minted by the intended person, someone else could buy or squat that name and then claim the tip, which is a security risk. Another on-chain approach is to use a secret passcode: e.g., user A could hash a secret and store it with the funds; they share the secret with Alice off-chain (say via a QR code or message). When Alice comes, she provides the secret to the contract (proving she got it from A) and the contract releases the funds to her UP address. This still requires a communication channel and trust that the secret is only given to the real Alice.

* **Custodial vs. Non-Custodial:** Importantly, if our platform (backend) itself takes custody of the tip intending to hold it for Alice, that introduces custodial risk and likely regulatory complexity – we’d become responsible for those funds. It’s far better to use a smart contract escrow that neither we nor any single party can unilaterally drain (except a rightful claimant). The escrow contract could have a timeout as well: if unclaimed after some period, perhaps the tipper can reclaim their funds or extend the wait, to avoid indefinite lockup. All these rules would be coded in the contract upfront, ensuring they execute automatically and transparently.

* **Recommendation:** Given the **complexity and trust issues** of a truly trustless escrow for unknown users, a more practical solution is to encourage both parties to have Universal Profiles. For instance, the app can detect “user not found” and prompt the tipper to “invite” the recipient to create a UP (perhaps generating a link). Once the recipient creates their profile, the tipper can then send the tip normally. This avoids holding user funds in limbo. If an escrow must be implemented, careful consideration must be given to using audited contracts and possibly decentralized oracles, to maintain as much trustlessness as possible in the system.

## Conclusion

Implementing tipping with arbitrary on-chain assets on LUKSO is feasible with the robust Universal Profile system and LSP standards. We can list a user’s assets by reading their profile’s stored data, resolve human-readable profile identifiers to addresses via indexing services, and leverage the Universal Profile Browser Extension to seamlessly send LYX, LSP7 tokens, or LSP8 NFTs. The process for sending tokens is very similar to Ethereum’s, with some LUKSO-specific parameters (like the `force` flag and 32-byte token IDs) which we illustrated with code examples. All transactions remain non-custodial – the user directly authorizes them, and our app just facilitates the interaction.

Handling tips to users who haven’t joined the platform or created a profile is an *optional, advanced feature*. It requires an escrow mechanism that introduces new challenges. While smart contracts can act as autonomous escrow agents to hold funds until certain conditions are met, determining those conditions (e.g. verifying identity) often leans on oracles or off-chain input, which reintroduce elements of trust. Therefore, the simplest path is to focus on the core tipping functionality where both parties have Universal Profiles. This core system can be achieved with LUKSO’s tools and a mix of front-end and back-end logic as described. The result will be a smooth user experience: a tipper can choose an asset from their profile, enter the recipient’s handle, and send tips that the recipient immediately owns on-chain via their Universal Profile – showcasing the power of LUKSO’s social blockchain standards for seamless value transfer.

**Sources:** The implementation details and code examples are based on the official LUKSO documentation and community resources, including LUKSO’s tech docs on transferring LYX, LSP7 tokens, and LSP8 NFTs, as well as the Universal Profiles concepts from LUKSO’s Medium articles and open-source projects like LukUp. The escrow discussion references general blockchain escrow principles to ensure any proposed design remains aligned with trustless ideals.
