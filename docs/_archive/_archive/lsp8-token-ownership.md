Perfect, thank you! I’ll investigate the correct `tokenOwnerOf` function signature and ABI for LSP8, how token IDs should be converted to `bytes32`, and how best to use `window.lukso` or Wagmi with ethers.js on the LUKSO mainnet. I’ll also include working code examples and highlight real-world implementation details and common pitfalls gathered from both official and community sources.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have the findings ready.


# LSP8 Token ID Verification – Analysis & Best Practices

## Converting Token IDs to **bytes32** Format

**LSP8 token IDs must be 32 bytes long (64 hex chars + `0x` prefix)**. The Lukso standard allows token IDs to be numbers, addresses, or any unique identifier encoded as a 32-byte value. In practice, this means you need to pad or format the token ID to a 32-byte hex string before calling contract functions:

* **Numeric IDs:** Convert the number to hex and left-pad it with zeros to 32 bytes.
* **Hex string IDs:** Ensure it’s 66 characters (including the `0x`). Pad with leading zeros if shorter.
* **Address or other 20-byte values:** Treat them as hex strings and pad to 32 bytes (address `0xabc...123` becomes `0x000...00abc...123` 32-byte hex).

For example, using **ethers.js** utilities:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
// Suppose tokenId can be a number, numeric string, or hex string:
function toBytes32(tokenId: string | number): string {
  if (typeof tokenId === 'string' && tokenId.startsWith('0x')) {
    // It's already a hex string – just pad to 32 bytes
    return ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(tokenId, 32);
  } else {
    // It's a number or decimal string – convert to BigNumber then to 32-byte hex
    const bn = ethers.BigNumber.from(tokenId);
    return ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(bn.toHexString(), 32);
  }
}
```

This will produce a 66-character hex string (e.g. `"0x0000...0001"` for token ID 1). Ethers **requires** the correct length; otherwise you get an “incorrect data length” error. In ethers v6, you can also use `toBeHex(tokenId, 32)` which directly returns a padded 32-byte hex string.

**Why pad?** The LSP8 function expects a `bytes32` value, so for token ID `0xabc` we must call `tokenOwnerOf(0x000...0abc)`. The provided implementation correctly does this padding (by slicing `0x` and using `padStart(64, '0')` for hex strings, or converting numbers via BigNumber) – this approach aligns with best practices.

## **`tokenOwnerOf(bytes32)` – LSP8 Ownership Check**

The LUKSO LSP8 standard defines **`tokenOwnerOf(bytes32 tokenId) view returns (address)`** as the way to query ownership of a specific NFT. This is analogous to ERC-721’s `ownerOf(uint256)` function, but using a `bytes32` tokenId:

* **LSP8:** `tokenOwnerOf(bytes32 tokenId) → address` – returns the owner’s address for the given token ID. It will **revert if the tokenId does not exist** (similar to ERC-721 requirements).
* **ERC-721:** `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) → address` – returns the owner address for a numeric token ID. (LSP8 renames this to avoid confusion and to emphasize the tokenId is not a simple uint.)

✅ **The function signature in your code is correct.** Using `'function tokenOwnerOf(bytes32) view returns (address)'` in the contract ABI is the right approach. This matches the official LSP8 interface. There is no alternative name; LSP8 deliberately uses `tokenOwnerOf` (different from ERC721’s `ownerOf`) to handle the bytes32 ID type.

When calling this function via ethers, pass the 32-byte token ID as discussed above. For example:

```typescript
const owner = await lsp8Contract.tokenOwnerOf(tokenIdBytes32);
```

This returns an address which you can compare to the user’s address. If they match (case-insensitive compare), the user owns that specific NFT. Your implementation does exactly this check in the `ownsSpecificToken` logic.

**Note:** If the token ID is invalid or not owned by anyone, the call will likely revert (throw). That’s why wrapping the call in a try/catch is important – a revert will be caught as an exception in JavaScript. In the catch, you can assume the requirement is not met (the token either doesn’t exist or isn’t owned by the user).

## ABI and Contract Interface for LSP8

To interact with an LSP8 contract, you should use an ABI that reflects its functions and types. At minimum, include:

* `balanceOf(address tokenOwner) view returns (uint256)` – to get how many NFTs an address owns.
* `tokenOwnerOf(bytes32 tokenId) view returns (address)` – to get the owner of a specific NFT.
* (Optional) `tokenIdsOf(address owner) view returns (bytes32[])` – to list all token IDs owned (if needed).
* Standard `name(), symbol()` if you need metadata (though LSP8 metadata is usually via ERC725Y keys).

For example, a minimal ABI in JSON format for the needed functions is:

```json
const LSP8_ABI = [
  {
    "inputs": [{ "internalType": "address", "name": "tokenOwner", "type": "address" }],
    "name": "balanceOf",
    "outputs": [{ "internalType": "uint256", "name": "", "type": "uint256" }],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [{ "internalType": "bytes32", "name": "tokenId", "type": "bytes32" }],
    "name": "tokenOwnerOf",
    "outputs": [{ "internalType": "address", "name": "", "type": "address" }],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  }
];
```

This matches the LSP8 interface (bytes32 tokenId for `tokenOwnerOf`). You can also express the ABI in human-readable form as you did (ethers.js allows using the function signature string). For instance:

```typescript
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, [
  "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)",
  "function tokenOwnerOf(bytes32) view returns (address)"
], provider);
```

Using the correct ABI ensures ethers knows how to encode the function call. If this ABI is wrong (e.g. using `uint256` instead of `bytes32` for tokenId), the call will fail or return incorrect data. Double-check that the contract address indeed supports the LSP8 interface – you could optionally call `supportsInterface(0x3a271706)` (the interface ID for LSP8 as of the latest spec) to verify. In older deployments the interface ID might be `0x1ae9ba1f` (LSP8 had updates in late 2023), but the function signatures remained the same.

## LSP8 vs ERC-721 – Key Differences in Ownership Checking

From a **verification logic perspective**, checking ownership is similar: you query the contract for the owner of a token and compare it to the user’s address. The differences are in the implementation details:

* **Token ID Type:** LSP8 uses `bytes32` for token IDs, whereas ERC-721 uses `uint256`. This means an LSP8 token ID could be a large number, a string/hashtag, or even an address encoded as bytes. ERC-721 token IDs are typically sequential uint256 values. Your code must handle hex strings and non-numeric IDs for LSP8 (as discussed in the conversion section).

* **Function Name:** The function to get an owner is `tokenOwnerOf` in LSP8 versus `ownerOf` in ERC721. Functionally they do the same thing (return an address owner), but you must call the correct name in the ABI.

* **Multiple Ownership Queries:** LSP8 adds `tokenIdsOf(address)` which returns an array of all `bytes32` IDs owned by an address. ERC-721 instead often relies on events or an optional enumeration extension (`tokenOfOwnerByIndex`) – LSP8’s direct query is a convenient addition for counting or listing NFTs.

* **Approval/Operator Model:** While not directly related to checking ownership, note that LSP8 handles approvals via **operators** (multiple operators can be authorized per token via `authorizeOperator(address operator, bytes32 tokenId, ...)`) instead of the single `approve` per token + `setApprovalForAll` model in ERC-721. This doesn’t affect your verification logic, but it’s a difference (e.g. `LSP8CompatibleERC721` extension exists to bridge this gap).

In summary, **to verify ownership of a specific NFT:** an ERC-721 check would do `owner = contract.ownerOf(tokenId)` vs. LSP8 does `owner = contract.tokenOwnerOf(tokenIdBytes32)`. Both then compare that `owner` to the expected address. Aside from the token ID formatting and function name, the concept is the same.

## Handling Proxy Contracts and Addresses

One potential gotcha is ensuring you call the **correct contract address** for the LSP8 token. Many LSP8 tokens are deployed as their own contracts (often via LSP8Mintable or similar). If the token was deployed via a factory or Universal Profile, it might be behind a proxy (upgradeable contract):

* **Proxy vs Implementation:** If the LSP8 is upgradeable (uses a proxy pattern like EIP-1967), you still interact with the **proxy address**. The proxy will delegate calls to the implementation. In most cases, calling `tokenOwnerOf` on the proxy works normally. Your code even includes logic to detect an EIP-1967 implementation slot. This is mainly useful for reading metadata (name/symbol) directly from the implementation if the proxy doesn’t expose those via ERC725Y. For balance and ownership, **always use the proxy address** for stateful queries – the token ownership data lives in the proxy’s storage.

* **Verifying correct contract:** Ensure the `contractAddress` you use is indeed the LSP8 contract of the NFT collection, **not** the Universal Profile address of a user. LSP8 NFTs are *contracts*, separate from user profiles (LSP0 accounts). For example, a Universal Profile might own the NFTs, but the `tokenOwnerOf` call should target the NFT contract. If a wrong address is used (like an LSP0 profile or a token that isn’t LSP8), the function call will fail (throw).

If you suspect the contract might be a proxy and you have issues calling it, you can manually check the implementation address: read storage at slot `0x3608...bc` (the EIP-1967 slot) as your code does. But generally, if `tokenOwnerOf` is reverting unexpectedly, double-check the address and ABI first – proxies should forward the call transparently if set up correctly. All mainnet LSP8 contracts should implement `tokenOwnerOf(bytes32)` as per standard.

## Provider Setup for LUKSO Network Calls

Using the **LUKSO Universal Profile browser extension** (similar to MetaMask, but for LUKSO) as the provider is correct. The extension injects a `window.lukso` object into the browser. Your code snippet shows a `getProvider()` that does:

```typescript
return new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.lukso);
```

This is the right way to get an ethers.js provider for the LUKSO chain. It wraps the injected provider, allowing you to make read/write calls. Make sure the user is connected and the extension is installed – your connection logic handles this (calling `window.lukso.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` to get permission).

**Chain ID:** LUKSO mainnet’s chain ID is **42** (hex `0x2a`). The extension should automatically use this when connected to mainnet, but your code also checks and can request a network switch. It’s important that the provider is on the correct chain, otherwise `tokenOwnerOf` calls could be hitting Ethereum or a testnet (and would fail or return nothing useful). The check `isCorrectChain` in your context helps enforce that.

No special RPC quirks are required for LSP8 – once the provider is connected to LUKSO, calling a contract function is the same as Ethereum. You can also use a direct RPC provider (e.g. `new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.mainnet.lukso.network")`) for read-only operations if you don’t require the user’s wallet. But using the user’s wallet provider (window\.lukso) is fine for `call` (view) operations and necessary for any transactions.

**Wagmi Note:** If you use wagmi hooks, you might have a connector for Lukso that internally uses `window.lukso`. Ensure that wagmi’s provider is configured for chain 42 and uses the injected connector. Your approach in context is manually managing the connection, which is also okay. The key point is that the provider object must be an EVM provider pointing to LUKSO. Your implementation meets this requirement (it finds `window.lukso` and uses it).

## Common Pitfalls & Error Handling

**Token ID formatting errors:** If the tokenId isn’t properly formatted as 32 bytes, the call will error out. We addressed this by padding the ID. Always include the `0x` prefix and ensure length 66. For example, passing `"0x1234"` without padding would throw an error – using `hexZeroPad` or equivalent prevents this.

**Non-existent token IDs:** Calling `tokenOwnerOf` for a token that hasn’t been minted will cause the contract to revert (since the standard requires `tokenId` to exist). In your code, the `try/catch` around the call is crucial. If an error is caught, you can assume `meetsRequirement: false`. It’s good to log the error for debugging (your console.error does this). Common error messages could be something like “LSP8: tokenId not found” depending on the implementation, or a generic Ethers error if it reverted without a custom message.

**Contract address issues:** If `tokenOwnerOf` throws an error like “contract method undefined” or similar, it could mean the contract at `contractAddress` does not have that function. This might happen if:

* The address is wrong (not an LSP8 contract).
* The user accidentally provided a proxy implementation address instead of the proxy (rare, but double-check).
* The contract is actually an LSP7 (fungible token) or something else. (In that case, using `tokenOwnerOf` is invalid.)

To guard against this, you could use the `supportsInterface` check as mentioned or catch the error and report that the contract is not an LSP8 token.

**Provider errors:** If `window.lukso` is not available (user hasn’t installed the extension), or the user is not connected, your calls will fail. Your code already handles this by early returns if no provider/upAddress. Make sure to surface a user-friendly error (e.g. “Please connect your Universal Profile wallet”). Also, if the user is connected to the wrong network (e.g. LUKSO testnet vs mainnet), the call might return an empty result or hit a different chain. The network switch logic covers this by forcing chain 42.

**Case sensitivity:** You correctly compare addresses by lowercasing them. LSP8 owner addresses should be checksummed or lowercase consistently. Just be sure the `upAddress` (user’s address) is obtained in a consistent format – it looks like you already lowercase it on compare, which is fine.

**Logging:** The console logs you added (e.g. logging the tokenId, the owner vs user, etc.) are very helpful for debugging. Keep an eye on them while testing with real tokens:

* `✅ LSP8 specific token ID verification: ...` confirms the function runs.
* `TokenOwnerOf result: owner=..., user=..., owns=true/false` shows the outcome. If `owner` comes back as a different address or an empty value, investigate if the user truly owns the token or if something’s off in the call.

## Example: Verifying LSP8 Token Ownership (Complete Flow)

Bringing it all together, here’s a simplified example of how you could verify a specific LSP8 token ownership using ethers.js:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Assume window.lukso is injected and user is connected
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.lukso);
const LSP8Interface = [
  "function tokenOwnerOf(bytes32 tokenId) view returns (address)"
];
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, LSP8Interface, provider);

async function verifyLSP8Ownership(contractAddress: string, tokenId: string, userAddress: string) {
  // 1. Format the tokenId to bytes32
  let tokenIdHex = tokenId;
  if (!tokenId.startsWith("0x")) {
    // If it's a number or decimal string
    tokenIdHex = ethers.BigNumber.from(tokenId).toHexString();
  }
  tokenIdHex = ethers.utils.hexZeroPad(tokenIdHex, 32);
  
  console.log(`Verifying ownership of token ${tokenIdHex} on contract ${contractAddress} for user ${userAddress}`);
  try {
    // 2. Call tokenOwnerOf on the LSP8 contract
    const owner = await contract.tokenOwnerOf(tokenIdHex);
    console.log(`tokenOwnerOf(${tokenIdHex}) -> ${owner}`);
    
    // 3. Compare with the provided user address (case-insensitive)
    const ownsToken = owner.toLowerCase() === userAddress.toLowerCase();
    if (ownsToken) {
      console.log("✅ User owns the token.");
    } else {
      console.log("❌ User does NOT own the token.");
    }
    return ownsToken;
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error calling tokenOwnerOf:", error);
    // If an error occurs (revert or network issue), treat as not owned or handle accordingly
    return false;
  }
}
```

This code incorporates the key points discussed:

* Pads the tokenId to 32 bytes (using `hexZeroPad`).
* Calls the correct `tokenOwnerOf(bytes32)` function on the contract.
* Catches errors (which could indicate a missing token or wrong contract).
* Compares the result to the user’s address.

Make sure to replace `contractAddress`, `tokenId`, and `userAddress` with real values when testing. Also, ensure the provider is connected to LUKSO (in this example we used `window.lukso` which requires the UP extension to be installed and connected). When tested with a real LSP8 token, you should see logs like:

```
Verifying ownership of token 0x000...01 for user 0x1234...abcd
tokenOwnerOf(0x000...01) -> 0x1234...ABCD
✅ User owns the token.
```

If the user doesn’t own it or the token doesn’t exist, you’d get a different address or an error and the output would indicate the requirement is not met.

## Additional Tips

* **Use Balance for Collection Gates:** For requirements like “own *at least* 1 NFT from this collection”, use `balanceOf(address)` on the LSP8 contract. LSP8’s `balanceOf` returns the count of NFTs owned by an address (just like ERC721’s balanceOf). You can then compare that to the `minAmount` threshold. Your implementation already plans for this (defaulting `minAmount` to "1" if not provided for LSP8) – that’s correct. Just ensure to handle BigNumber comparisons properly (convert both to BigNumber and use `.gte`) to avoid any numeric issues.

* **ERC725Y Metadata:** As you discovered, LSP8 doesn’t have `name()` and `symbol()` in the same way ERC20/721 do. They store metadata via ERC725Y data keys. You’ve implemented a solution using ERC725.js to fetch `LSP4TokenName` and `LSP4TokenSymbol`. That’s a great approach. Keep that in mind if you ever need to display token names – calling `contract.name()` might fail on some LSP8 tokens (if they didn’t implement those functions), so using the ERC725Y keys is the robust method.

* **Testing on LUKSO:** Try your verification with known LSP8 contracts. For example, the **Munchkins NFT** from LUKSO’s tutorial uses numeric token IDs. In that tutorial, they mint with `tokenId = toBeHex(1, 32)` and then `console.log(collection.tokenOwnerOf(tokenId))` to verify. This is essentially what your code will do programmatically. Testing with a token you own (or a testnet deployment) will give you confidence that the logic works end-to-end.

By addressing the token ID formatting and using the correct contract interface, your LSP8 verification should work reliably. The bug was likely due to not padding the token ID or using an incorrect type – with the adjustments above, the verification is fully aligned with the LSP8 standard. Good luck, and happy building on LUKSO! 🚀
