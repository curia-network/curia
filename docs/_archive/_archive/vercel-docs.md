Perfect, thanks for the clear details. I’ll gather precise, working answers for all 5 parts of your request using Vercel AI SDK 5.0 beta 6, the @ai-sdk/openai provider, and streamText in a Next.js 15 app with edge runtime.

I’ll return complete code examples and message flows for:

1. Tool definition syntax

5. TypeScript types and imports

I’ll get back to you shortly with everything you need to implement working tools in your AI chat assistant.


# Using Tools in Vercel AI SDK 5.0 Beta 6

## 1. Tool Definition Syntax

In **Vercel AI SDK 5.0 beta 6**, you should define tools using the `tool()` helper function provided by the `ai` package. **Do not use plain objects without `tool()`**, because `tool()` exists to help TypeScript infer the types of the tool’s parameters and return value. A tool definition typically includes:

* **`description`** – A string describing what the tool does (helps the model decide when to use it).
* **`parameters`** – A Zod schema or JSON schema defining the tool’s input arguments (Beta 6 uses the key name `parameters`, not `inputSchema`). This schema is given to the model and is also used to validate the model’s tool-call arguments. You can directly use a Zod schema (or use the provided `jsonSchema()` helper for JSON schemas).
* **`execute`** – An async function that will be called when the model invokes this tool, receiving the parsed arguments. **Yes, you should provide an `execute` function** (unless you plan to handle execution manually elsewhere). If `execute` is omitted, the tool will **not** run automatically. Typically, `execute` should return a result (string or object) that will be sent back to the model as the tool’s output.

Below is a **working example** of a simple tool definition in Beta 6:

```ts
import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const weatherTool = tool({
  description: 'Get the weather in a specified location',
  parameters: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
  }),
  // The 'location' parameter is inferred as string, thanks to tool() helper
  execute: async ({ location }) => {
    // (Example implementation – in real case, call a weather API)
    const temperature = 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10;
    return { location, temperature };
  },
});
```

This syntax will compile without TypeScript errors. The `tool()` function infers that `execute` receives an object `{ location: string }` based on the Zod schema. The result returned (here an object with `location` and `temperature`) will be JSON-serialized and fed back to the model as the tool’s output.

## 2. Tool Integration with `streamText()`

To use your tools with the `streamText()` function in Vercel AI SDK 5.0 beta 6, pass them via the `tools` option as an **object** mapping tool names to tool definitions (the `ToolSet`). **Do not use an array** – the correct format is an object with keys as tool names and values as the tool objects. For example:

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const response = await streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-4'),               // your OpenAI model provider
  messages: /* your conversation history (converted to model messages, see Q4) */,
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,              // include the tool defined above
    // ... you can add more tools here
  },
  // optional settings:
  toolChoice: 'auto',                  // 'auto' (default) lets the model decide when/if to use tools:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
  maxSteps: 3,                         // allow up to 3 steps (tool calls + answer) in one response:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
});
```

In the code above, we pass an object with a `weather` property set to our `weatherTool`. The key `"weather"` is the name the model will use to invoke the tool. The SDK will expose this name and the tool’s description/schema to the model under the hood. By default, `toolChoice` is `'auto'`, meaning the model may choose to call a tool or answer directly. You can also force a tool call (`'required'`), disable tools (`'none'`), or require a specific tool by name.

If you want the model to possibly use multiple tools or have a multi-step reasoning process (tool calls followed by more model output), set `maxSteps > 1`. For example, `maxSteps: 5` allows the model to call tools and then continue the conversation in up to 5 total steps. With `maxSteps: 1` (the default), the model will only generate one step – if it uses a tool in that step, the process ends there without a follow-up answer (so usually you’d increase `maxSteps` to get a final answer after the tool result).

No other special configuration is needed to enable tool usage. Simply ensure your `tools` object is provided to `streamText()`, and the SDK will handle the rest (formatting tool definitions for the model and capturing any tool invocations).

## 3. Tool Execution Handling

In beta 6, tool execution is handled automatically by the SDK when using `streamText` or `generateText`. If the model’s response includes a tool invocation, the SDK will **call the corresponding tool’s `execute` function for you** on the backend. You do **not** need to manually intercept the tool call in an `onFinish` or other callback to execute it – the `execute` function you defined will run and produce a result (unless you deliberately omitted `execute` to handle it differently).

Here’s the flow of events in a multi-step `streamText` call involving a tool:

1. **Model triggers a tool call (Step 1)** – The user’s prompt plus context is sent to the model. The model’s output indicates it wants to use a tool (e.g. it “decides” to call `weather` with some location). At this point, `streamText` will stop the streaming text and treat this as a **tool call** event. (In the SDK’s terms, this is a `ToolCall` content part in an assistant message.)
2. **SDK executes the tool** – The SDK immediately calls your tool’s `execute` function with the arguments provided by the model. This happens server-side within the `streamText` workflow. The `execute` function runs (e.g. fetches weather info) and returns a result object.
3. **Inject tool result and continue (Step 2)** – The SDK takes the result from `execute` and inserts it into the conversation as a special **tool result message**. Then, the model receives this tool output as context for a new generation step. The SDK automatically prompts the model again, now including the tool’s result, so the model can use it to formulate a final answer.
4. **Model produces final answer** – The model sees the tool result and responds with normal text (or it could conceivably call another tool if allowed and steps remain). This answer is streamed back to the client as the assistant’s reply.

The SDK manages this multi-step loop up to the `maxSteps` limit. Each iteration of *tool call -> tool execution -> tool result -> next model response* counts as a step.

**Callbacks:** You can hook into this process with optional callbacks:

* **`onStepFinish`**: Called at the end of each step (when the model has finished either a text answer or a tool call + result). This is useful for logging or streaming intermediate results. For example, you could use:

  ```ts
  const result = streamText({
    /* ... */,
    onStepFinish({ text, toolCalls, toolResults, finishReason }) {
      // This runs after each step is completed
      console.log('Step finished. Tool calls in this step:', toolCalls, 'Results:', toolResults);
    },
  });
  ```

  The `onStepFinish` callback will fire for each step, including the step where a tool was called (after the tool result is obtained), and the final step with the answer. You get access to the text generated in that step (if any), any tool call made, and any tool result returned in that step. This is a good place to update application state or store the conversation history incrementally.
* **`onFinish`**: Called once at the very end of all steps (when the entire streaming is done). In a Next.js API route, you might use this to close any streaming data or perform cleanup. For example, if using the `StreamData` helper (as in Vercel’s examples) you would call `data.close()` in `onFinish` to signal the SSE stream completion. If you’re not using a low-level stream, you may not need to use `onFinish` at all; the promise returned by `streamText()` will resolve when complete.

In summary, you do **not** manually execute tools in the callback; the `execute` function runs automatically when the model requests a tool. Your main job is to define the tool and possibly handle the results or updates via callbacks if needed. The **complete flow** is managed by the SDK, which ensures tool calls and results are incorporated into the message stream properly.

## 4. Message Format for Tools

When using tools in Beta 6, the message format needs a little attention, but the SDK provides utilities to handle it. **Yes, you should still use `convertToModelMessages()`** on the server if you are receiving UI messages (e.g. from a React hook or client component) and preparing them for `streamText`. In AI SDK 5, there are separate types for UI messages vs. model messages. You should maintain conversation history as `UIMessage` objects on the client, then convert them to the compact `ModelMessage` format for the model call. For example:

```ts
import { convertToModelMessages, type UIMessage } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();
  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4'),
    messages: convertToModelMessages(messages),  // convert UI -> model messages
    tools: { /* ... your tools ... */ },
    maxSteps: 5
  });
  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```

In the above pattern (typical for a Next.js API route), `messages` are converted via `convertToModelMessages` before being passed to `streamText`. This utility strips away any UI-specific data and ensures the messages are in the proper structure (`role` and `content` fields) that the model expects. **If you skip this conversion and pass `UIMessage` objects directly, you may encounter errors or the SDK might prompt you to use `convertToModelMessages`** (as this is a common requirement in v5 beta).

**Tool call message format:** You do not need to manually format tool invocation messages. The SDK will handle the special message types when a tool is invoked or a result is returned. Under the hood:

* When the model decides to call a tool, the SDK represents it as an assistant message with a **ToolCallPart** (internally an object indicating which tool and what arguments). This is not something you manually create; the model’s output triggers it.
* After execution, the tool’s result is inserted as a `role: "tool"` message containing the result (a **ToolResultPart**). In OpenAI’s terminology, this is analogous to a function result message (role “function”), but the AI SDK uses `"tool"` role internally for tool outputs. Again, you don’t create this yourself; the SDK will do it once your `execute` returns a value.

The **bottom line** is that you just maintain the normal chat history (system/user/assistant messages) in UI format and convert to model messages on the server. The SDK will append any tool call and tool result messages to the conversation as needed during `streamText`. These tool-related messages will also appear in the `steps` or final `messages` returned by `streamText`. For instance, you can inspect `result.steps` to see all intermediate messages, including tool calls and results, across each step. If you use `toUIMessageStreamResponse()` or similar, the stream will include those tool results properly integrated as parts of the assistant’s response stream. There’s no special extra formatting required from your side beyond using the provided conversion function for input messages.

## 5. TypeScript Types and Imports in Beta 6

Vercel’s AI SDK beta 6 introduced new types and helpers for tools and messages. Here’s what you need to import and use for a correct TypeScript setup:

* **Core imports for tools:**

  ```ts
  import { tool, ToolCallUnion, ToolResultUnion, type ToolExecutionOptions } from 'ai';
  ```

  * `tool` – function to define tools (as shown above).
  * `ToolCallUnion` and `ToolResultUnion` – generic helper types to infer the union types of all possible tool calls or tool results for a given tool set. For example: if you have a `const tools = { a: tool(...), b: tool(...) }`, then `ToolCallUnion<typeof tools>` will be the TS union type of all tool call objects (either calling `a` or `b`), and `ToolResultUnion<typeof tools>` likewise for results. These are useful if you want to type variables or functions that handle generic tool calls/results.
  * (Optional) `ToolExecutionOptions` – the type of the second argument passed to `execute` (includes properties like `toolCallId`, `messages`, `abortSignal` as shown in docs). You typically don’t need to import this unless you want to type that parameter; the SDK will infer context types for you.

* **OpenAI provider import:**

  ```ts
  import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
  ```

  This gives you the model function (e.g. `openai('gpt-4')`) to use as the `model` in `streamText` or `generateText`. It’s already known you have this from your setup, but just to be clear, you import your provider-specific model from the `@ai-sdk/*` package. (If you need types for the messages specific to OpenAI, you could import `OpenAIMessage` or similar, but generally using the core `ModelMessage` via conversion is enough.)

* **Message types:**
  If you maintain chat history on the client, you will interact with `UIMessage` (from the `ai` package) for the rich UI-friendly message type. On the server, after conversion, you deal with `ModelMessage` (often via the `CoreMessage` type union internally). Typically you can rely on the helper function `convertToModelMessages` to handle these, but you can import the types if needed:

  ```ts
  import { type UIMessage, type ModelMessage, convertToModelMessages } from 'ai';
  ```

  This is useful for typing the request payload (e.g. `messages: UIMessage[]` as shown above) and understanding the shapes. The `CoreMessage` schema (which includes roles `'user' | 'assistant' | 'system' | 'tool'`) is available if needed, but most of the time you won’t import it directly.

* **Tool parameters and return types:**
  When using `tool()`, the parameter types for `execute` are inferred from your Zod schema, and the return type is inferred from your function’s return. If you want to explicitly type the return (for clarity or to catch mistakes), you can annotate the function. For example:

  ```ts
  execute: async ({ location }): Promise<{ location: string; temperature: number }> => { ... }
  ```

  But this isn’t strictly necessary if you return a literal object matching what you want – TypeScript will infer it. The SDK ensures that whatever type you return is the type of the tool’s result. If you need to reuse these types (say, in your UI when displaying tool outputs), you could extract them by defining an interface for the result, or using the `ToolResultUnion` as mentioned. For instance:

  ```ts
  type Tools = typeof tools;
  type WeatherResult = Extract<ToolResultUnion<Tools>, { tool: 'weather' }>['result'];
  ```

  This would give you the result type of the `"weather"` tool. This is advanced usage; you can also simply know that in this case it returns `{ location: string; temperature: number }`.

* **Breaking changes from earlier betas:**
  If you were using an earlier beta (e.g. beta 4 or beta 5), note a few changes in beta 6:

  * The property for tool parameters is now consistently called `parameters` (if you saw references to `inputSchema` in older examples, that has been unified to `parameters` in recent versions).
  * The function `tool()` existed in beta 5 as well, but it’s now clearly the recommended way – you should wrap your tool definitions with `tool()` to avoid losing type inference.
  * The `maxToolRoundtrips` setting was renamed or superseded by `maxSteps` in later beta versions. In beta 6, you should use `maxSteps` for multi-step tool usage. (The older `maxToolRoundtrips` might have been a term in beta 3/4; by beta 6 the terminology moved to `maxSteps`.)
  * Make sure to use the new message conversion and streaming helpers (`toUIMessageStreamResponse`, etc.) as shown above, since the architecture changed significantly from SDK v4 to v5.

In summary, to implement tools in your Next.js (Edge runtime) app with Vercel AI SDK 5.0 beta 6, ensure you have the correct syntax and types as outlined. By following the examples above – defining tools with `tool()`, passing them in the `streamText` call, and handling messages and steps with the provided utilities – you should be able to get fully functional tool usage in your chat assistant **without TypeScript errors**. All code and patterns shown here align with the official beta 6 documentation and examples, so you can use them as a reference for your implementation. Good luck with building your AI-powered assistant!
