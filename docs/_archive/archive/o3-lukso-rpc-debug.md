Thanks for running those tests — very helpful. I’ll now investigate why certain LUKSO RPC endpoints fail network detection in ethers.js v5 within Node.js environments, identify any known incompatibilities, and provide production-ready solutions and configurations for reliable backend usage.

I’ll get back to you shortly with working configurations, code examples, and best practices for ethers.js provider setup with LUKSO in Node.js.


# Connecting ethers.js v5 to LUKSO – Debugging “Could Not Detect Network” Errors

## Background: LUKSO’s Chain ID vs Ethers.js Expectations

LUKSO Mainnet uses **Chain ID 42**, which historically belonged to Ethereum’s Kovan testnet. In ethers.js v5, chain ID 42 is still mapped to the network name “kovan” (with Kovan’s ENS settings). This means that when ethers v5 sees chainId 42, it will identify it as Kovan by default. LUKSO is a separate blockchain that happens to reuse 42, so this **chain ID conflict** can cause confusion (e.g. `provider.getNetwork()` returning `{ name: "kovan", chainId: 42 }` as you observed). Importantly, **LUKSO’s execution client is standard EVM**, so its JSON-RPC interface is Ethereum-compatible. The chain ID overlap doesn’t break functionality by itself – it just labels the network incorrectly in ethers v5 (a documentation issue noted by the ethers maintainers).

**Key point:** LUKSO’s RPC should behave like any Ethereum RPC. The “could not detect network” error is **not** because LUKSO is non-Ethereum or incompatible – it’s usually due to how ethers attempts to detect the network on provider initialization.

## Understanding Ethers.js Network Detection (JsonRpcProvider)

When you create a `JsonRpcProvider` without explicitly specifying the network, ethers v5 will **auto-detect the network** by querying the RPC endpoint. Internally, ethers sends an `eth_chainId` call (and falls back to `net_version` if needed) as soon as you call any network-dependent method (or `.getNetwork()` explicitly). The detection logic is roughly:

1. Call `eth_chainId`.
2. If that throws or returns nothing, call `net_version` (an older RPC method).
3. Take the returned chain ID (from one of those) and look up a predefined network entry.

   * If chainId matches a known network (e.g. 42 -> Kovan in ethers v5), it returns that Network object.
   * If the chainId is unknown to ethers’ static list, it throws an “invalid network” error.
4. If no response is obtained from the RPC, it throws a **"could not detect network"** error (event=`"noNetwork"`).

In your error logs, the message was `event="noNetwork"`, which indicates that **ethers didn’t get any chain ID response at all** from the RPC. This usually means the JSON-RPC endpoint didn’t respond or the response was not understood, rather than an unrecognized chain ID. If it were an unknown chain ID, the error would be `event="invalidNetwork"` with the chainId included. So, the likely cause is **connection failure or no reply** from the RPC endpoints during network detection.

## Possible Causes for the “noNetwork” Error

From the details, several factors could be contributing:

* **RPC Endpoint Connectivity/Format:** The LUKSO RPC endpoints might not be returning the expected result for `eth_chainId` in your Node environment. For example, the Thirdweb endpoint `lukso-mainnet.rpc.thirdweb.com` appears to have been problematic – your tests showed it failing to respond, whereas the endpoint `42.rpc.thirdweb.com` succeeded. It’s possible that `lukso-mainnet.rpc.thirdweb.com` is an incorrect or deprecated URL. (LUKSO’s docs only list `https://42.rpc.thirdweb.com` for Thirdweb, not the “lukso-mainnet” subdomain.) Using an invalid URL would indeed result in no response, triggering the `noNetwork` error. Always double-check that the RPC URL is correct and functional.

* **Public RPC Reliability:** Even the official LUKSO RPC (`rpc.mainnet.lukso.network`) can occasionally be slow or rate-limited. The LUKSO docs explicitly *“recommend developers use 3rd-party RPC providers over our public RPC URL for better performance and stability.”* This implies the official RPC might sometimes not answer within your 10s timeout or could drop requests under load. If the initial `eth_chainId` call timed out or failed due to RPC issues, ethers would throw the network detection error. (In your first logs, it seemed even the official RPC wasn’t responding quickly, though in a later test it did.) High latency or intermittent failures on the RPC will manifest as “could not detect network”.

* **Chain ID Mismatch (unlikely in this case):** If a node returned a chainId that ethers didn’t recognize, it would throw an error with `event="invalidNetwork"`. For LUKSO, ethers *does* recognize 42 (as Kovan), so this is probably not the direct cause here. However, it’s worth noting that in ethers **v6**, if Kovan support is removed, chain 42 might be treated as unknown (unless they add LUKSO’s name). In v5.8.0, chain 42 is still recognized (albeit mislabeled). So this is more of a naming issue than a connectivity issue.

* **Node vs Browser Environment:** The reason your frontend (browser) had no issues is likely because it uses a different provider mechanism. Web3-Onboard with ethers v5 would use `Web3Provider(window.ethereum)` or a wallet’s provider, which **already knows the network** (the user’s wallet is connected to LUKSO). In that scenario, ethers doesn’t need to call out to `eth_chainId` on its own – the injected provider typically supplies the network info. In contrast, your Node.js backend is creating a **direct JSON RPC connection** to the endpoint, which has to perform that network check. The browser environment also might have had the LUKSO network pre-configured (by adding it in MetaMask with chainId 42), so everything was aligned and no detection needed beyond what the wallet provided. The Node.js context lacks that pre-configured knowledge unless you supply it. In short, **the same ethers version behaves differently**: in the browser it piggybacks on the wallet’s network, whereas in Node it must explicitly query the RPC. This explains why one environment worked and the other didn’t, even with the same RPC URLs.

* **Misconfiguration or Timing in Next.js:** Ensure that your Next.js server-side code isn’t trying to create/use the provider at an invalid time. Typically, in an API route, you should instantiate the provider within the handler function (so it runs at request time, not at import time during build). If a provider is created too early (e.g., at module load in a serverless function) it might run in a context where environment variables aren’t set or network is unavailable. However, this is a less likely cause here, given that you did see the error logs (so the provider was being created). Just double-check that `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LUKSO_MAINNET_RPC_URL` is defined server-side (Next.js will expose `NEXT_PUBLIC_...` vars to client by default, but on the server you might need it in your environment config as well). If that env var were missing, your URL list might have been incomplete. But since you had fallbacks coded, you likely covered this.

## Solution 1: Explicitly Specify the Network in ethers.js Provider

The most straightforward fix is to **provide the network parameters when instantiating the JsonRpcProvider**. This bypasses the automatic network detection. In ethers v5, `new JsonRpcProvider(connectionInfo, network)` will use the supplied `network` object and skip the initial `eth_chainId` check (it trusts what you provided). You attempted this with the `luksoNetwork` object `{ name: 'lukso', chainId: 42, ensAddress: undefined }`. Make sure you pass it correctly as the second argument **every time** you create the provider, including in any fallback/retry logic.

For example:

```ts
const luksoNetwork: Network = { name: 'lukso', chainId: 42, ensAddress: null }; 
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  { url: rpcUrl, timeout: 10000 }, 
  luksoNetwork
);
```

By doing this, `await provider.getNetwork()` should immediately return `{ name: 'lukso', chainId: 42, ... }` without error. Your test snippet showed this working: the explicit config yielded a network with chainId 42 and name “lukso” (which you set) and avoided the detection error. With this approach, subsequent calls like `provider.getBlockNumber()` and contract calls will proceed normally as long as the RPC itself responds. Essentially, you’re **telling ethers what network to expect**, so it won’t double-check by calling `eth_chainId` on startup.

**Important:** Use the same explicit network object consistently for all endpoints in your fallback array. If you only pass it for one URL and not others, those others will still attempt auto-detection. In a custom fallback implementation, ensure each JsonRpcProvider is created with the network param. (If you use ethers’s `FallbackProvider`, see below, you would pass the network to each underlying provider as well.)

Note that using an explicit network avoids the chainId verification. If a given RPC endpoint were accidentally pointing to the wrong network (e.g., if you pointed to LUKSO but set chainId 1 for Ethereum), you could get mismatched data without ethers noticing. In our case, we know all these URLs are for LUKSO mainnet (42), so it’s fine to skip the check.

## Solution 2: Use the Correct and Reliable RPC Endpoints

Double-check the RPC URLs in your configuration:

* **Thirdweb RPC:** Use `https://42.rpc.thirdweb.com` (the official Thirdweb endpoint for LUKSO mainnet). This one succeeded in your tests. Avoid `lukso-mainnet.rpc.thirdweb.com` – it’s either deprecated or requires special access. The LUKSO docs and Chainlist only list the numeric subdomain. Thirdweb’s free RPC should work in Node without any API key.

* **Official RPC:** `https://rpc.mainnet.lukso.network` – it did work for you in a standalone script, but keep in mind LUKSO’s warning about its stability. It’s fine to include as a fallback, but you might not want to rely on it as the primary in production if it’s rate-limited.

* **Other RPC Providers:** LUKSO lists additional community RPC endpoints: e.g., SigmaPrime’s `https://rpc.lukso.sigmacore.io` and others like NowNodes or Envio. Consider adding one of these as another fallback. Thirdweb alone might be sufficient, but having a secondary (SigmaCore is noted to have higher rate limits) can improve resilience.

By using a **pool of RPC URLs**, you mitigate single-point failures. You can implement this in two ways:

**A)** *Manual fallback logic*: As you have, try one URL, catch errors, then try the next. This gives you control to log each failure. With explicit network config on each, it would look like:

```ts
const RPC_URLs = [...]; 
let provider: JsonRpcProvider | null = null;
for (const url of RPC_URLs) {
  try {
    provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider({ url, timeout: 10000 }, luksoNetwork);
    await provider.getBlockNumber();  // test the connection
    console.log(`Connected via ${url}`);
    break; // success
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`RPC ${url} failed:`, err);
  }
}
if (!provider) throw new Error("All LUKSO RPC endpoints failed");
```

This approach explicitly tests each endpoint. Your logs already show a variant of this. Just ensure `luksoNetwork` is passed in the constructor so that `getBlockNumber()` doesn’t itself trigger detectNetwork (though calling getBlockNumber will obviously make a network request, but it won’t repeat the chainId check).

**B)** *ethers FallbackProvider*: ethers.js has a `FallbackProvider` which can take multiple providers and race requests between them. You could do something like:

```ts
const providers = RPC_URLs.map(url => new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider({ url, timeout:10000 }, luksoNetwork));
const fallback = new ethers.providers.FallbackProvider(providers, /* quorum */ 1);
```

With `quorum: 1`, the first provider to return a result will be used. This can improve response time and automatically handle if one node is down (the slow/offline one will be bypassed by the faster response of another). The FallbackProvider will also round-robin or load-balance subsequent requests after a provider failure. This approach abstracts away the manual try-catch and gives you a single `fallback` provider to use for all calls. Just be sure all sub-providers have the correct network passed in. One downside is less granular error logging for each endpoint – but you can listen to the fallback provider’s events or the individual providers’ `.anyNetwork` events if needed.

Either way, **using multiple endpoints** is a best practice for production dApps. It ensures that even if one RPC endpoint is having issues, your backend can still serve requests using an alternate.

## Solution 3: Increase Timeout or Introduce Retries

You’ve already set a 10,000ms timeout on the provider. If you suspect that’s still too low (perhaps the RPC occasionally takes >10s to respond under load), you could increase it. However, 10s is already quite generous for a read call. If an `eth_chainId` is taking over 10 seconds, the endpoint is likely struggling. In such cases, relying on a quicker alternate RPC (solution 2) is better than bumping timeouts further.

Implementing a **retry mechanism** is wise. If a call fails due to a transient network issue, you can catch the error and retry it on the same provider once or twice before switching. This could handle scenarios where a provider hiccups but recovers moments later. Libraries like axios-retry (for REST) aren’t directly applicable to ethers, but you can manually re-call functions or use the fallback mechanism which inherently tries multiple sources.

Also consider **monitoring connectivity continuously**: e.g., have a background job that pings `getBlockNumber()` or subscribes to new blocks, so you can detect if one provider becomes unresponsive and log or switch proactively. For Node processes that stay running, you might even rotate providers periodically to distribute load.

## Solution 4: Upgrade to Ethers v6 (with Caution)

Ethers v6 is the latest major version. In terms of this issue:

* **Chain 42 identification:** As of early 2024, ethers v6 still had chainId 42 labeled as “kovan”. There was an open issue suggesting updating that to LUKSO, but no resolution shown. So by default, v6 might still call your network “kovan” unless updated. However, you can similarly specify a custom network in v6 when creating a provider. In fact, v6 introduced a `StaticJsonRpcProvider` class that is meant for fixed networks (no auto-detection). You could use:

  ```ts
  import { StaticJsonRpcProvider, Network } from 'ethers';
  const network: Network = { chainId: 42, name: "lukso" };
  const provider = new StaticJsonRpcProvider(rpcUrl, network);
  ```

  This will ensure no network switching or re-detection occurs. If using `JsonRpcProvider` in v6, the concept is similar – pass a Networkish.

* **Library improvements:** Ethers v6 has some performance improvements and updated APIs (e.g., it uses `BigInt` for BigNumbers). Upgrading might not directly solve the connectivity issue (since it’s largely about RPC responsiveness and configuration). But v6 would give you the StaticJsonRpcProvider and possibly better error messages. It’s worth noting that v6 might be stricter in some areas – if it doesn’t recognize chain 42 at all (say they dropped Kovan mapping and didn’t add LUKSO), calling `getNetwork()` *without* a network param could throw an “unknown network” error. This again is solved by explicitly providing the network as shown.

* **Migration cost:** The migration from ethers v5 to v6 will require some code changes (for example, `provider.getBalance()` returns a BigInt in v6, not a BigNumber, and many functions are renamed or moved). Given your timeline (24-48 hours) and the fact that a configuration tweak in v5 can fix the issue, an immediate upgrade might not be necessary. You could plan to upgrade later once this feature is unblocked, if there are other compelling reasons to use v6. But **v6 is not a guaranteed quick fix** for this specific problem – you’d still need to handle the custom network id or ensure the RPC responds.

In summary, upgrading is optional here. Ethers v5 can work with LUKSO; just configure it properly. If you do upgrade, leverage StaticJsonRpcProvider and test thoroughly.

## Solution 5: Use Alternative Web3 Libraries (if needed)

If ethers.js v5 continues to be troublesome, you have other options to interact with LUKSO in the backend:

* **Viem (formerly Ether.js from wagmi team):** Viem is a modern Typescript-first EVM library known for performance and easy custom chain integration. It natively supports custom chain configurations. In fact, the wagmi/viem chain definitions include LUKSO’s testnet and likely mainnet. For example, using viem:

  ```ts
  import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';
  import { lusko } from 'viem/chains'; // hypothetically if viem defines LUKSO mainnet
  // If not predefined, you can supply an object with { id: 42, name: 'lukso', rpcUrls: [...] }
  const client = createPublicClient({
    chain: { id: 42, name: 'lukso', rpcUrls: ['https://42.rpc.thirdweb.com'] },
    transport: http()
  });
  const balance = await client.getBalance({ address: upAddress });
  ```

  Viem does not perform an implicit network detection handshake like ethers; you configure the chain ID upfront (similar to static provider). This can avoid the class of error you faced. Viem also has utilities for ABI encoding and contract calls (you’d use `client.readContract` or `client.call` for the ERC-1271 `isValidSignature`). The downside is learning a new library and possibly losing some of the familiar ethers.js syntax, but viem’s documentation is solid, and it’s designed for exactly these scenarios where custom chain support is needed.

* **Web3.js:** The old Ethereum web3 library can connect to any RPC by just specifying the URL. It won’t try to “detect” the network; it leaves that to the user. For instance:

  ```js
  const Web3 = require('web3');
  const web3 = new Web3('https://42.rpc.thirdweb.com');
  const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(upAddress);
  ```

  This would give you the balance (as a string of wei). And for the ERC-1271 call, you could use `web3.eth.call` with the contract data. However, coding the contract call might require manual ABI encoding or using web3’s contract abstractions. Since you already have ethers types/ABI, switching to web3.js might be more effort than it’s worth. Web3.js is also promise-based but has historically had callback remnants and less convenient BigNumber handling.

* **Thirdweb SDK / LUKSO-specific SDKs:** Given that Thirdweb provides the RPC, they also have an SDK that might abstract some calls. But the Thirdweb JS SDK is more focused on contract deployment, NFT minting, etc., and may not directly provide a simple “call arbitrary contract” functionality beyond what ethers does under the hood. There is also a **LUKSO Universal Profile SDK** (ERC725 SDK) which helps with reading Universal Profile data, but for signature verification you really just need the raw call. So introducing a large SDK might be overkill. It’s perfectly fine to stick with ethers and just get it working.

* **Direct JSON-RPC fetch:** In a pinch, you could perform the JSON-RPC calls yourself with `fetch` or axios. For example, to get chainId:

  ```js
  const res = await fetch(rpcUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc:"2.0", id:1, method:"eth_chainId", params:[] })
  });
  ```

  and similarly for `eth_call` to invoke `isValidSignature` on the contract. However, doing this means manual crafting of RPC payloads and parsing hex responses – essentially reimplementing what ethers or viem would do. This approach sacrifices the convenience and safety of a library, so it’s not recommended unless you’re debugging at a low level.

**Recommendation:** Stick with **ethers v5** (since you’re already using it) but apply the network config and fallback fixes. Ethers is fully capable once configured. Move to other libraries only if you find a specific feature of ethers is lacking or if you prefer the ergonomics of another library. Viem, for instance, is a great choice for new projects, but switching now should be weighed against time constraints.

## Best Practices for LUKSO + Node.js Integration

To ensure a production-ready, maintainable solution, consider these practices:

* **Use Multiple RPC Providers:** As discussed, combine the official RPC with a third-party service. This not only avoids downtime but can also balance load. Thirdweb’s free RPC is convenient, but if your app grows, keep an eye on any rate limits or usage guidelines they have (Thirdweb’s public RPC is generally robust, but heavy usage might warrant a dedicated node or a provider with SLA).

* **Handle Errors Gracefully:** The error you encountered (`NETWORK_ERROR` with “noNetwork”) is one example of a connectivity issue. In production, you might also see errors like timeout errors or `SERVER_ERROR` from the RPC. Catch exceptions from provider calls (`getBalance`, contract calls, etc.), and implement a strategy: e.g., if it’s a transient network error, you might retry on another provider. For signature verification, if the call fails, you could even respond with a retry-suggested error to the client. But ideally, your backend hides these retrials internally and only responds once it’s sure the call truly failed on all fronts.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Continue logging failures with details (which RPC URL failed, error code/message). This will help diagnose if one endpoint becomes unreliable or if the error pattern changes. You might also instrument the response times of calls to catch if an endpoint is turning slow. Over time, this lets you decide which providers to favor. In a production environment, consider setting up alerts if, say, all RPCs fail for a period (so you know the feature is impaired).

* **Keep Chain Data in Sync:** Since ethers v5 will call LUKSO “kovan” unless you override the name, be mindful of any logic that keys off `provider.network.name`. You’ve wisely set the name to 'lukso' in the custom Network object – this avoids confusion downstream (for example, if you had logic like `if(provider.network.name !== 'lukso') ...`). If using ethers v5 default (without custom network), it would return name 'kovan'. Simply treat chainId as the source of truth (42 == LUKSO mainnet). There’s no built-in ENS on LUKSO (and ethers’ Kovan ENS settings won’t apply meaningfully), so you likely won’t be using provider.resolveName or such. But if you ever do, ensure you don’t inadvertently use Ethereum Kovan’s ENS registry address on LUKSO chain – that wouldn’t make sense. Setting `ensAddress: null` or undefined in the network object (as you did) is correct to signify no ENS.

* **Test with Simple Scripts:** Before deploying changes, test the connectivity in a minimal Node script (like your `test-lukso-rpc.js`). This isolates the provider logic from the rest of your app. You’ve seen how helpful that is. For example, test each RPC URL for retrieving chainId and a recent block:

  ```ts
  const { ethers } = require('ethers');
  const luksoNet = { name: 'lukso', chainId: 42, ensAddress: null };
  const urls = [
    'https://rpc.mainnet.lukso.network',
    'https://42.rpc.thirdweb.com',
    'https://rpc.lukso.sigmacore.io'
  ];
  for (let url of urls) {
    console.log(`Testing ${url}...`);
    try {
      const prov = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider({ url, timeout: 5000 }, luksoNet);
      const net = await prov.getNetwork();
      console.log(' Network OK:', net);
      const block = await prov.getBlockNumber();
      console.log(' Block number:', block);
    } catch(err) {
      console.error(' Failed:', err.code, err.reason || err.message);
    }
  }
  ```

  This kind of script can quickly show if an RPC is down or slow. In your case, you found Thirdweb’s numeric URL and the official RPC worked (returning a block number \~5 million, which matches current LUKSO block heights), whereas the `lukso-mainnet.rpc.thirdweb.com` failed. Doing such tests periodically (even as part of a health check) can preempt issues.

* **Validate the Feature End-to-End:** Once the provider connectivity is sorted, verify the **ERC-1271 signature check and balance check** logic:

  * For a valid signature (one that the Universal Profile’s contract recognizes via `isValidSignature(bytes32,bytes)`), the contract should return the magic value `0x1626ba7e`. Ensure your code handles this correctly (ethers will return a bytes32 result – you might compare it to the constant or check `result === '0x1626ba7e'`).
  * For an invalid signature, it returns a different value (or may revert, depending on implementation – ERC-1271 spec says return 0x00000000). Your backend should then reject the request as not authorized.
  * The balance check (`provider.getBalance(upAddress)`) returns a BigNumber (in v5) representing wei. Ensure you interpret it properly (e.g., compare against a threshold in wei, or convert to LYX for logging). If using BigInt (v6 or viem), adjust accordingly.
  * Test with an address that has no LYX to see that your logic correctly handles insufficient balance gating.

* **Security Consideration:** Since this is an authZ gating feature, ensure that the message being signed cannot be replayed. Typically you’d include a nonce or timestamp in the message that the user signs, and your backend would verify the signature (via ERC-1271) and then perhaps mark that nonce as used. This is outside the scope of the RPC issue, but critical for avoiding replay attacks if someone intercepts a signature. Given you have the basic verification in place now, you might already be doing this (just a reminder).

* **Ensuring Maintained Connectivity:** In the long run, monitor announcements from LUKSO. If they ever *change* the chain’s RPC or if ethers v5 updates to label 42 differently, you’ll want to adjust. For example, if ethers 5.9+ or 6.x eventually includes “lukso” in the network list, you might remove your override to avoid having two conflicting definitions of chainId 42. It’s something to watch for, though it likely won’t change soon. The GitHub issue suggests maybe a documentation fix rather than a code change, so ethers might leave 42 as “kovan” in v5.x.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

By applying the above solutions, your backend should be able to **successfully connect to the LUKSO network** and perform contract calls without the “could not detect network” error:

* **Root Cause Resolved:** The error was caused by ethers’ network auto-detection failing (likely due to an unresponsive or wrong RPC URL). We addressed this by supplying the network context manually and using reliable endpoints.

* **Working Configuration:** Use `JsonRpcProvider` with `{ chainId: 42, name: 'lukso' }`. This ensures `getNetwork()` returns chainId 42 immediately and no error.

* **Alternate Approaches:** If ethers v5 was still not working, we discussed moving to ethers v6 or viem, which can handle custom chains. Those are backups – in principle, your current stack will work with the right tweaks.

* **Code Example Implemented:** Update your provider creation code in the Next.js API route to something like:

  ```ts
  const luksoNet = { name: 'lukso', chainId: 42, ensAddress: null };
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider({ url: LUKSO_RPC_URL, timeout: 10000 }, luksoNet);
  ```

  and similarly for any fallback URLs. Then use `provider` to call `isValidSignature` and `getBalance` as before. This change is minimal but critical.

* **Validation:** After deploying the fix, test the full flow: a user with a Universal Profile signs the challenge, your backend uses `provider` to call `UPContract.isValidSignature(hash, sig)`. It should return the magic value (or throw if something’s wrong). Check that logic, then ensure `provider.getBalance(profileAddress)` returns a BigNumber and that your gating logic correctly interprets it (e.g., user has ≥ required LYX). Monitor the logs – you should no longer see “noNetwork” errors. Instead, you’ll only see errors if perhaps the signature is invalid or if the RPC itself goes down.

With these measures, the backend **will trust the specified network and robustly connect**. You’ll be unblocked to complete the Universal Profile gating feature. In production, the multi-endpoint strategy and logging will help maintain reliability for your LUKSO integration, giving users a smooth experience when proving ownership of LYK or Universal Profiles.
