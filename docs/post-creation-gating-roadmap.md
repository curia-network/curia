# Post Creation Gating Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Complete the board lock system by implementing **post creation gating** - preventing users from creating posts until they verify board lock requirements. This pairs with existing comment gating to provide complete content control at the board level.

## Current State vs Target State

### Current State âœ…
- âœ… **Comment Gating**: Users must verify locks before commenting
- âœ… **Board Lock Configuration**: Admins can set multiple locks with ANY/ALL fulfillment
- âœ… **Verification Modal**: Working board verification with real-time status updates
- âœ… **Backend Verification**: Lock-specific verification with 4-hour expiry

### Target State ðŸŽ¯
- ðŸš€ **Post Creation Gating**: Users must verify locks before creating posts
- ðŸš€ **Unified Verification Flow**: Same verification modal for both posts and comments
- ðŸš€ **Smart UX**: Guide users through verification before they write long posts
- ðŸš€ **Complete Board Control**: Lock requirements apply to ALL content creation

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
```
User clicks "Create Post" 
â†’ Check board lock requirements
â†’ If verification needed: Show verification modal
â†’ User completes verification  
â†’ Allow post creation
â†’ Backend validates verification before saving post
```

### Integration Points
1. **Frontend Gating**: Pre-flight verification check
2. **Backend Validation**: Server-side verification enforcement  
3. **UI/UX Integration**: Seamless verification flow
4. **Cache Management**: Real-time status updates

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Frontend Pre-Flight Verification (2-3 days)**
**Priority**: High - Core user experience

**Goal**: Check board lock requirements before showing post creation form

#### 1.1 Board Lock Status Integration
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/app/page.tsx` (main board page with "Create Post" button)
- `src/components/modals/ModalContainer.tsx` (post creation modal container)

**Changes Needed**:
```typescript
// Add board verification status to main page
const { data: boardVerificationStatus } = useBoardVerificationStatus(boardId);

const handleCreatePost = () => {
  if (boardVerificationStatus?.hasWriteAccess) {
    // User verified - show post creation form
    setShowPostModal(true);
  } else {
    // User needs verification - show verification modal
    setShowVerificationModal(true);
  }
};
```

#### 1.2 Verification Modal Integration
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/components/boards/BoardVerificationModal.tsx` (extend for post creation context)
- `src/hooks/useBoardVerificationStatus.ts` (ensure board-wide status hook exists)

**New Components**:
- `src/components/boards/PostCreationGate.tsx` - Smart wrapper component

**PostCreationGate Architecture**:
```typescript
interface PostCreationGateProps {
  boardId: number;
  communityId: string;
  onVerificationComplete: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode; // Post creation form
}

// Logic: Show children if verified, verification modal if not
```

#### 1.3 User Experience Enhancements
**UX Flow**:
1. **Prevention**: Don't show post creation until verified
2. **Guidance**: Clear messaging about verification requirements
3. **Progress**: Show verification progress and remaining requirements
4. **Success**: Smooth transition to post creation after verification

**UI Components**:
- Lock requirement summary in post creation button
- Verification progress indicators
- Success confirmation with transition animation

### **Phase 2: Backend Validation (2-3 days)**
**Priority**: Critical - Security enforcement

**Goal**: Validate board lock verification before allowing post creation

#### 2.1 Post Creation Endpoint Enhancement
**File**: `src/app/api/posts/route.ts`

**Current Logic**:
```typescript
// POST /api/posts
// 1. Validate user auth
// 2. Validate board access (role-based)
// 3. Create post
```

**Enhanced Logic**:
```typescript
// POST /api/posts  
// 1. Validate user auth
// 2. Validate board access (role-based)
// 3. ðŸš€ NEW: Validate board lock verification
// 4. Create post
```

**Board Lock Validation Logic**:
```typescript
// Get board's lock requirements
const boardResult = await query(`
  SELECT settings FROM boards WHERE id = $1
`, [boardId]);

const lockGating = SettingsUtils.getBoardLockGating(boardSettings);

if (lockGating.lockIds.length > 0) {
  // Check user's verification status for required locks
  const verificationResult = await query(`
    SELECT lock_id FROM pre_verifications 
    WHERE user_id = $1 AND lock_id = ANY($2) 
      AND verification_status = 'verified' AND expires_at > NOW()
  `, [userId, lockGating.lockIds]);
  
  const verifiedLockIds = new Set(verificationResult.rows.map(row => row.lock_id));
  
  // Apply fulfillment logic
  const hasAccess = lockGating.fulfillment === 'any'
    ? verifiedLockIds.size >= 1
    : verifiedLockIds.size >= lockGating.lockIds.length;
    
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'Board lock verification required',
      requiresVerification: true,
      lockIds: lockGating.lockIds,
      fulfillmentMode: lockGating.fulfillment
    }, { status: 403 });
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Error Handling & User Messaging
**Verification Failure Scenarios**:
1. **No Verification**: User never verified any required locks
2. **Partial Verification**: Some locks verified, but not enough for fulfillment mode
3. **Expired Verification**: User was verified but expired
4. **New Requirements**: Board requirements changed since last verification

**Error Response Format**:
```typescript
interface PostCreationBlockedResponse {
  error: string;
  requiresVerification: true;
  lockDetails: {
    lockIds: number[];
    fulfillmentMode: 'any' | 'all';
    verifiedCount: number;
    requiredCount: number;
    nextExpiryAt?: string;
  };
  message: string;
}
```

#### 2.3 Performance Optimization
**Database Efficiency**:
- Single query to check all lock verifications
- Index optimization for user_id + lock_id lookups
- Caching of board lock configurations

**Query Optimization**:
```sql
-- Efficient batch verification check
SELECT 
  l.id as lock_id,
  pv.verification_status,
  pv.expires_at
FROM locks l
LEFT JOIN pre_verifications pv ON l.id = pv.lock_id AND pv.user_id = $1
WHERE l.id = ANY($2)
  AND (pv.verification_status = 'verified' AND pv.expires_at > NOW())
```

### **Phase 3: Advanced UX & Polish (2 days)**
**Priority**: Medium - User experience refinement

#### 3.1 Smart Post Creation Integration
**Features**:
- **Verification Status in UI**: Show lock status in post creation button
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal verification requirements gradually
- **Optimistic UI**: Allow post drafting during verification process
- **Draft Persistence**: Save post drafts during verification flow

**UI Enhancements**:
```typescript
// Smart post creation button
<PostCreationButton 
  boardId={boardId}
  verificationStatus={boardVerificationStatus}
  onRequiresVerification={() => setShowVerificationModal(true)}
/>

// States:
// 1. "Create Post" (verified)
// 2. "Verify to Post" (not verified) 
// 3. "Verify 2 more locks to post" (partial)
// 4. "Re-verify to post" (expired)
```

#### 3.2 Verification Success Flow
**Post-Verification Experience**:
1. **Success Animation**: Smooth transition from verification to post creation
2. **Status Persistence**: Remember verification status across sessions
3. **Guided Onboarding**: Help new users understand the verification system
4. **Quick Re-verification**: Fast path for expired verifications

#### 3.3 Error Recovery & Edge Cases
**Edge Case Handling**:
- **Mid-Creation Expiry**: Verification expires while user is writing post
- **Requirement Changes**: Board requirements change during post creation
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation and retry mechanisms
- **Multiple Windows**: Sync verification status across browser tabs

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1-2 days)**
**Priority**: High - Quality assurance

#### 4.1 Integration Testing
**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Happy Path**: User verifies â†’ creates post successfully
2. **Verification Required**: Unverified user guided through verification
3. **Partial Verification**: ANY mode with 1/3 locks verified
4. **Expired Verification**: User must re-verify before posting
5. **Changing Requirements**: Admin changes locks during user session

#### 4.2 Performance Testing
**Load Testing**:
- Post creation with verification checks under load
- Database query performance with large user bases
- Frontend responsiveness during verification flows

#### 4.3 Security Testing
**Security Validation**:
- Backend validation cannot be bypassed
- Verification expiry properly enforced
- Race condition handling (verification expiring during post creation)
